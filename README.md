Publicly available research initiatives like Horizon Europe provide a vast amount of information on research and innovations in the Health domain, but the sheer volume and diversity of data present unique challenges in understanding dynamics and extracting meaningful insights. Advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and text mining offer a powerful opportunity to bridge this gap by systematically exploring these open-access resources for knowledge extraction and thematic organization. Through a combination of computational methods, data visualization, and cross-dataset comparisons, we aim to analyze the dynamics of Horizon Europe research investment and its contributions to Health.

## Data

The CORDIS dataset contains information about projects and their results funded by the European Union under the Horizon Europe framework programme for research and innovation from 2021 to 2027.

The dataset is composed of six (6) different sub-set (in different formats):

    HORIZON projects – which includes participating organisations, legal basis information, topic information, project URLs and classification with the European Science Vocabulary (EuroSciVoc)
    HORIZON project deliverables (meta-data and links to deliverables)
    HORIZON project publications (meta-data and links to publications)
    HORIZON report summaries (periodic or final publishable summaries)

Reference data (programmes, topics, topic keywords funding schemes (types of action), organisation types and countries) can be found in this dataset: https://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/data/dataset/cordisref-data

EuroSciVoc is available here: https://data.europa.eu/data/datasets/euroscivoc-the-european-science-vocabulary

CORDIS datasets are produced monthly.

Remark: While the main focus will be on Horizon Europe projects, analytical methods can be extended to other EU-funded programs or even global research initiatives. Therefore, you can either stick to the CORDIS dataset, and/or extend it with additional open-source information.
HORIZON projects

### HORIZON projects

The CORDIS EU Research Projects under Horizon Europe (2021–2027) dataset provides detailed information on projects funded by the European Union's Horizon Europe framework program. This dataset includes several key variables that offer insights into each project's specifics:

    Project Identifier (ID): A unique alphanumeric code assigned to each project for identification purposes.
    Project Acronym: A shortened form or abbreviation representing the project's title.
    Project Title: The official name of the research project.
    Project Description: A brief overview outlining the project's objectives, methodologies, and expected outcomes.
    Start Date: The commencement date of the project.
    End Date: The scheduled completion date of the project.
    Project Status: Indicates whether the project is ongoing, completed, or terminated.
    Total Cost: The overall budget allocated for the project, including all funding sources.
    EU Contribution: The amount of financial support provided by the European Union for the project.
    Funding Scheme: The specific Horizon Europe funding mechanism under which the project falls.
    Coordinator Details: Information about the lead organization managing the project, including name, location, and contact details.
    Participants: A list of all organizations involved in the project, along with their roles and countries of origin.
    Topics: The research areas or themes addressed by the project, aligned with Horizon Europe's priorities.
    Programme: The specific program or sub-program under Horizon Europe that funds the project.
    Call Identifier: The reference to the specific call for proposals to which the project responded.
