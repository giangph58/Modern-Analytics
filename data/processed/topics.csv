Immune cells use sophisticated ways to detect and destroy abnormal cells, while sparing our own cells. Unluckily, cancer cells often develop sneaky tricks enabling them to evade this protecting machinery and to survive and proliferate. Immunotherapy, an emerging concept of treatment, aims to employ the power of immune system to fight cancer by boosting or reeducation of immune cells. One of the approaches, the adoptive cell transfer therapy, especially in the form of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) cells, has shown an unprecedented success in the treatment of certain types of cancer. CAR cells are genetically modified immune cells engineered to recognize and kill cells with specific cancer antigen. Unfortunately, production of genetically modified CARs is problematic, inefficient, time consuming and therefore, associated with high costs. New approaches enabling production of modified immune cells more effectively, faster and cheaper could therefore change the way the therapy is used. Within this proposal, we will explore the potential of an innovative approach for production of chemically engineered immune cells and their application in immunotherapy. In particular, we will employ our technology based on combination of metabolic engineering and subsequent biocompatible chemical labeling to produce an antibody modified natural killer (NK) cells that we will investigate in cancer killing experiments. We will perform a side-by-side comparison of our technology with the ‘traditional’ CAR-NK cells both, in vitro and in vivo, to evaluate the pros and cons of both approaches. Finally, in collaboration with our Tech Transfer Office, we will present the technology to potential stakeholders to bring it to the next step in the form of patent licensing or eventually, develop the technology further within spin-out company.', 'Targeting the vascular-immune interface to induce anti-tumor immunity\nIn this ERC Synergy Grant, we will characterize the vascular-immune interface in melanoma and glioblastoma and explore the perivascular niche as a site for local anti-tumor immune activation.Cancer immunotherapy has made tremendous progress in the last two decades, but a vast majority of cancer patients do not benefit from this progress yet. Refinement of established immunotherapies will undoubtedly increase response rates. However, conceptually brave new therapies must be developed to make additional breakthroughs. The tumor vasculature plays a key role in orchestrating anti-tumor immunity by regulating recruitment and activation of T-cell and other immune cells. We propose to make a detailed characterization of vascular immune landscapes in melanoma and glioblastoma and to utilize this to optimize vascular-immune crosstalk and immune response as a new breakthrough immunotherapy.This proposal builds upon new knowledge on how immune hubs can form around tumor vasculature, which to a large part is based upon novel findings and development by the applicants (1, 2) on the importance of perivascular antigen-presenting niches in activating, sustaining, and executing CD8 and CD4 T-cell-mediated immune attacks on cancer. We will develop tumor vessel targeting AAV vectors that can enable therapeutic induction of immune hubs in cancer. This new form of immunotherapy will be evaluated alone and in combination with established cancer immunotherapies.Combined, our research teams are in a unique position to achieve this goal. Synergistic advancements will be obtained by joining Dimberg’s expertise in the vascular and immune microenvironment in tumors (especially glioblastoma); Tüting’s expertise in tumor immunology and cell plasticity (especially melanoma); and Essand’s expertise in translational gene therapy and cancer immunotherapy. The project is timely, and if successful can bring immunotherapy to the next level, rendering new hope to millions of cancer patients.', 'Engineering B cells to fight cancer\nB cells have an important role in the immune response against cancer. Tumor specific B cells in tertiary lymphoid structures and anti-tumor antibodies in the plasma are associated with a favorable prognosis and with an improved response to checkpoint inhibition in different sarcomas and carcinomas. Antigen specific B cells home to tumors and prolong survival in mice, while B cell based vaccines allow durable anti-tumor activity in cervical cancer patients. We have recently demonstrated both ex vivo and in vivo B cell engineering for the expression of anti-HIV antibodies. Here, we propose a novel cancer immunotherapy approach based on engineered B cells. In particular, we use CRISPR/Cas9 and AAV to target the integration of anti-tumor antibody genes into the IgH locus. In diverse tumor models, we plan to demonstrate localized B cell activation upon antigen engagement. The B cells will exert multiple anti-tumor effects. Secreted antibodies will induce ADCC, CDC and ADCP. In addition, a polyclonal T cell response with epitope spreading will be facilitated by engineered B cells acting as APCs as well as by antibodies forming immune complexes to be taken up by dendritic cells and macrophages for cross-presentation. The B cell will be co-engineered to locally secrete additional immune effectors upon activation. These include: stimulatory cytokines, BiTEs, checkpoint inhibitors, CD40/27 agonists and cell penetrating nanobodies. Localized secretion is predicted to increase efficacy while reducing systemic toxicities. When targeting self-antigens, B cells will be engineered to co-express a CAR, relaying CD40 or TLR signals for T cell independent B cell activation and allowing allogeneic therapy. We will further demonstrate in vivo B cell engineering for increased scalability, and ensure safety using a suicide cassette for inducible B cell elimination. B cell engineering is thus a flexible and robust platform technology that may revolutionize cancer immunotherapy.']"

It examines the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the sector and explores policies and strategies in Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Scotland, and Spain through comparative studies. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach and mixed methods, the project investigates factors affecting VET student engagement, including demographics and socio-economic backgrounds, by analyzing longitudinal data and conducting in-depth interviews with selected students. This research aims to provide insights into young people's educational paths in post-pandemic Europe, highlighting differences in socio-economic status and educational aspirations, as well as differences between the pre- and post-pandemic cohorts. VETprep’s combination of generalized knowledge and individual narratives will offer a nuanced picture of Youths in the post-pandemic Europe. Furthermore, with a comparative focus on differences across the European Countries and across different young people according to socioeconomic status, academic achievements, etc., we get the opportunity to understand both the consequences and relevant actions in the light of individual differences and varying societal, political, and educational frameworks in the five European countries. The project aims to help policymakers and other stakeholders (a) meet their obligations under the EPSR (everyone has the right to quality and inclusive education, training and lifelong learning, including reducing the NEET rate to 9% by 2030) (b) implement the Council Recommendation on VET for sustainable competitiveness, social fairness and resilience (c) meet the goals of Pathways to School Success, including reducing Early Leaving from Education (d) meet UN SDGs 4, 8, 9 & 10."", 'For trustful, participatory and inclusive public policies\nINVOLVE\u202f\u202f For trustful, participatory and inclusive public policies\u202f\u202f Across Europe there is evidence of the existing distrust in political institutions and the increased stratification of political involvement across Europe, with more vulnerable citizens having less access and influence in the decision-making process. The COVID 19 pandemic has exposed and reinforced these trends. These shifts pose a great challenge to the democratic welfare state.\u202f\u202f INVOLVE’s main objective is to help design scalable and generalizable strategies to reduce social, economic, and political inequalities. The project builds on systematic quantitative research into the trends, causes and complex relationships between democracy and inequalities. The project also focuses on how public and social services engage with vulnerable groups of citizens, especially in the age of digitalization. It will involve vulnerable groups in 8 European countries as co-researchers to complement and refine the results. In a series of concrete pilots of action-research, their aspirational capacity and their power of voice are strengthened to bring about concrete change in public services and social policies.\u202f\u202f INVOLVE will not only involve vulnerable citizens facing multiple inequalities, but also political and public decision-makers, NGOs representing vulnerable groups and experts to develop viable political strategies in order to achieve more trust-based governance in public services, to contribute to the development of a more participatory and socially responsible society.\u202f\u202f The final stage of INVOLVE aims to contribute to democratic participation in social policies at local, national, transnational and European level through campaigns with viable policy recommendations.

Building on this premise, REGROUP (Rebuilding governance and resilience out of the pandemic) aims to: 1) provide the European Union with a body of actionable advice on how to rebuild post-pandemic governance and public policies in an effective and democratic way; anchored to 2) a map of the socio-political dynamics and consequences of Covid-19; and 3) an empirically-informed normative evaluation of the pandemic. REGROUP pursues this threefold objective via a multi-level (national, supranational, international) and multi-sphere (political, societal, ideational, digital) research approach, and guided by three overarching analytical themes: “reordering”; “risk”; “resilience”. We operate in nine collaborative work packages—grouped in three blocks: “diagnosis”, “evaluation”, and “prescription”—bringing together expertise and methods from a range of social sciences and humanities. Doing so, we advance the state of the art conceptually, theoretically, and methodologically. REGROUP is conducted by a consortium of 13 internationally renowned institutions, committed to scholarly excellence, inclusiveness, and open science. The project is designed to achieve a high degree of policy, societal, and scientific impact, which it will achieve via a multi-pronged dissemination and communication strategy. This includes links to some of the EU’s main debates and events, such as the Health Union, the Green Deal, the Digital Decade, the Economic Governance Review, the Conference on the Future of Europe, and the 2024 European Parliament elections.']"

The gold standard treatment is bone tumor resection followed by reconstruction of the tissue, thereby allowing the salvage of the limb. Titanium and its alloys are mostly used in such orthopedic surgeries due to their biocompatibility and excellent mechanical properties. A novel, cutting-edge technology of patient-specific implants, 3-dimensional (3D) printed porous titanium implants, was recently introduced to clinical use. Yet, even several years after surgery, the resected section is not fully reconstructed, leading to further medical complications often requiring re-operations. A promising solution is the combination of titanium porous implants with bioactive scaffolds to support bone regeneration following tumor resection. Here, we aim to fabricate a 3D-printed porous titanium implant incorporated with patent-protected bioactive materials we have developed in the scope of the PersonalBone ERC-StG project to provide an optimal microenvironment for stimulating bone regeneration following bone tumor resection. For this purpose, we will optimize the formulation as well as the method of incorporation into 3D-printed titanium implants. The incorporated implants will be tested for biocompatibility and osteointegration in critical-size bone defect models in vivo. As we recently demonstrated for the novel materials, we will examine several success criteria, which will be refined according to input from orthopedic oncology surgeons who routinely perform tumor resections. This novel technology is envisioned to significantly advance the current treatments offered following bone resection, thereby considerably reducing the risk of further complications and offering a major improvement in the quality of life of patients recovering from bone cancer.', 'In vitro 3D cell models of healthy and OSTEOpathological ageing bone tissue for implantation and drug testing in a multidisciplinary NETwork\nOSTEONET aims to (i) build a multidisciplinary research network involving experts of technical and medical disciplines to merge their expertise and exploit possible synergies for the development of reliable and sustainable 3D in vitro cell models of healthy and aged bone tissue and (ii) train a cohort of scientists and technologists in exploiting the model features to increase knowledge on the effects of ageing on bone biology and mechanobiology, and on bone response to drugs, to leverage the use of 3D cell models in clinics and basic/industrial research labs.Bone ageing reduces the quality of life of the elderly and puts social and economic burden on society. Ageing bones fail more easily when challenged mechanically or with toxicants or pollutants, and respond differently to drugs than healthy bone. To personalize therapies and enable better preventive care for the elderly it is essential to develop reliable and sustainable in vitro models of aged bone tissue alternative to animal tests which often fail to capture human-specific features. Several scientific studies support the idea that in vitro models of bone tissue are an outstanding resource for (i) the comprehension of bone physiology, (ii) a better understanding of pathological pathways in most bone dysfunctions, (iii) testing new or repurposed drugs for bone treatment before preclinical trials with animal models.The networking activities planned in OSTEONET will unravel and share knowledge on the mechanisms driving the information transfer from the biochemical and biomechanical levels, which drive osteosynthesis and osseointegration, to the cascade of molecular and cellular events emerging as an elaborated and physiological bone, and on the mechanisms of the different response of healthy and aged bone tissue to mechano-biological stimuli and drugs.', ""Bioactive reinforcing bioink for hybrid bioprinting of implantable bone\n3D bioprinting is an emerging technique that offers promise for fabricating implantable tissues. Despite significant advancements, the field struggles to replicate the mechanical robustness and biological complexity of native tissues, particularly in applications requiring high mechanical strength such as bone. This proposal introduces 'BioForceInk,' a bioactive reinforcing bioink designed for direct bioprinting alongside a cell-laden hydrogel within a cell-conductive environment. The microparticle-based bioink is printable at room temperature and solidifies at 37°C, forming a stiff, porous scaffold within the construct. Our preliminary studies demonstrated its excellent printability, mechanical properties, and osteoconductive capabilities in a hybrid bioprinting context. To enhance vascularized bone differentiation in vitro and support bioprinted implant integration and bone recovery in vivo, the bioink will be enriched with osteogenic and vasculogenic factors.Throughout this project, we aim to develop the growth factor-loaded BioForceInk and utilize it for creating vascularized bone implants by hybrid bioprinting in tandem with cell-laden soft bioink. We will then evaluate the regenerative potential of the bioprinted vascularized bone implants in a critical-size bone loss model. Additionally, we plan to test the technology with industrial partners and prepare it for commercialization by the end of the project. BioForceInk offers a unique combination of mechanical support and biological activity that facilitates the single-step fabrication of physiologically relevant bone implants. This innovation has the potential to significantly narrow the gap between bioprinting technology and clinical application, contributing to the development of personalized, mechanically robust, and biologically functional bone implants. With its tunable properties, BioForceInk could be further adapted for bioprinting of various tissues, reflecting its broad potential across the field.""]"

Treatment of these diseases is by Ear-Nose-Throat (ENT) surgeons, operating with incomplete knowledge of the tumor geometry, under non-ergonomic conditions and with limited precision on fragile cancerous tissue. AIRCARE will bring clinical practice in diagnosis and surgical treatment to the next level, by introducing advanced AI and robotic technology into the clinical workflow. For diagnosis, AIRCARE will enable real-time on-the-spot AI-powered optical/electric biopsies, helping to optimize a patient-specific surgical approach. For surgery, AIRCARE will provide a more controlled and ergonomic setting. Novel robotic stabilizing and controlling tools will further allow manipulation of tissue and removal of cancer with unprecedented levels of precision. A newly developed intuitive 3D visualization will simplify the understanding of the complex surgical scene. Aside from increase of safety, quality and efficiency of the surgical procedure, also less experienced surgeons may become able to perform complex image guided treatments. Within this innovation action, our European partners spanning universities, research centers, industry and 3 hospitals, will join forces across disciplines to advance promising research prototypes into two advanced integrated systems: one for diagnosis, one for surgery, thus supporting clinicians from the detection and diagnosis of UADT diseases until their surgical treatment. Within the framework of the project, the superiority of AIRCARE technology will be demonstrated in real operational environments through three clinical studies.

Currently, approximately 20% of breast cancer patients require a second operation due to incomplete removal of cancerous tissue. This results in increased costs for the healthcare system and significant negative effects on patients’ well-being. Nowadays, the standard margin assessment procedure is postoperative histopathological specimen analysis, which takes several days to complete. Although intraoperative histopathological analysis on frozen tissue is possible, it is less effective and cannot be implemented in all clinical centers. Alternative techniques have been suggested but have low diagnostic performance or take excessive time to assess the entire resected specimen.Spectra-BREAST aims to support surgeons with an intraoperative tool providing accurate and actionable feedback on the resection margin status over the whole specimen in less than 5 minutes. To this end, we will apply a radically new, high-risk multimodal approach combining two optical techniques, Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) and fiber-optic Raman Spectroscopy (RS) with AI-based data-analysis. HSI and AI will be used for fast and sensitive detection of suspicious margins, which are subsequently analyzed by RS, and a second AI will make the final prediction on the RS spectra. The ambition is to identify tumors on and below the resection surface (up to a depth of 2 mm), with an unprecedented high sensitivity and specificity (over 95%) in real-time. Spectra-BREAST also has the potential for wider applications, going beyond breast cancer to include margin assessment for other cancers, robotic/laparoscopic surgery, and guided biopsy. Finally, Spectra-BREAST will offer an objective technology reducing variability between patients, and most importantly, will improve patient outcomes such as reduced hospital stays, complications, anxiety, and improved cosmetic outcomes.', 'Quantitative Ultrasound Stochastic Tomography - Revolutionizing breast cancer diagnosis and screening with supercomputing-based radiation-free imaging.\nUltrasound imaging can be deeply enhanced by means of algorithms developed in the field of geophysical imaging. Such algorithms, based upon adjoint-state modelling and iterative optimization, provide quantitative images of human tissue with very high resolution. At present time, such images can only be attained by means of high-performance computing and using specific ultrasound data acquisition devices. When combined, hardware and software have a huge impact potential for soft-tissue imaging, such as in breast cancer imaging. Nevertheless, and as is customary in medical imaging, the obtained images only provide with the mean, or most likely, values of tissue at each pixel, being uncertainty quantification an extremely expensive process, typically deemed as unfeasible for practical purposes. A revolutionary development in adjoint-based ultrasound imaging allows us to potentially obtain images of uncertainties at the cost of a single, mean-value, image. Such development will be the basis of transformative implications in terms of confidence-estimates for diagnosis. We aim at disrupting the breast cancer screening paradigm by means of a safe (radiation-free), accurate (quantitative) and reliable (uncertainty-aware) novel breast imaging modality.Within QUSTom we will investigate the fundamental science behind adjoint-based uncertainty imaging and establish its potential suitability for breast cancer diagnosis. The feasibility of the technology as a diagnosis tool relies on 1) adapting the data acquisition hardware for optimal resolution, 2) implementing the algorithms in high-performance computers in order to obtain a short time-to-solution and 3) feasibility analysis by expert radiologists in comparison with the state-of-the-art in breast imaging.This proposal covers the three aspects and opens the possibility of applying similar principles in other imaging fields, both in medicine and elsewhere.']"

Imbalances and disconnected food markets are generating undesirable trade-offs between the food supply, the consumption patterns, quality of nutrition and the environment. Interoperability and data sharing across agri-food supply networks is limited. Data can revolutionise the food industry and foster its contribution to inclusive and sustainable food systems. Data can be used to assist these stakeholders in making informed decisions on how to operate in a more sustainable and inclusive manner.

Despite food abundance in Europe, food insecurity threatens millions of European citizens, necessitating a comprehensive approach encompassing knowledge, technologies, behaviours, and policies that promote healthier and more sustainable food systems. Given citizen science (CS) as a potent tool for achieving these goals, SPOON takes the innovative approach to food insecurity by employing CS to empower citizens in creating a more inclusive and sustainable food environment. SPOONs four main aims are to: deepen scientific knowledge about food environments; increase capacity of policymakers in data-driven decision-making; foster cross-sector collaboration; increase agency of citizens to change their food consumption behaviour and local food environments; and foster more confidence in citizens in sharing personal food data. SPOON bridges the intention-action gap towards healthier and more sustainable diets by placing citizens at the forefront of transforming the food system through CS integration. SPOON's conceptual framework centres around six CS Labs in Europe, coordinated by local partners and utilising a multi-actor approach. Citizens engage as both researchers and subjects, testing and validating innovative digital tools to collect, analyse and interpret data on their food consumption behaviors and local food environments to then co-design and run small-scale behaviour change interventions together with other stakeholders.

Dietary shifts towards novel foods based on alternative protein sources (NFAP; proteins derived from insect, fungi, bacteria, micro and macro algae and agriculture and aquaculture by-products), provide a unique opportunity to reduce consumption of animal-based proteins potentially minimizing the impact of the Food Systems.  However, knowledge regarding the environmental, economic and social impact of the widespread production, provision and consumption of NFAP is very limited and not integrated into a holistic vision of the food system able to identify trade-offs, interaction between food system actors and second and third order impacts. The goal of EPIC-SHIFT is to provide an unprecedented, independent, solid knowledge base on the sustainability (env., eco. and soc.) aspects of NFAP as options for protein diversification for human consumption. Considering that the contribution of each NFAP types to reorganize the food systems may differ, EPIC-SHIFT applies a quadruple helix innovation model in its multi-actor approach to roadmap the sustainable development of NFAP for Planetary Health Diets. Designed as a think-tank and adopting Food Systems Thinking approach, EPIC-SHIFT will provide a multidimensional impact assessment of 7 NFAP (from protein type to product level) at scale complemented with the necessary recommendations for food environments, marketing, regulatory approval, infrastructure and investment needed to support long-term market growth.

This project tackles the urgent need to develop new, technology-based sustainable strategies to combat the constant agricultural losses and economic drain derived from plant pests, which have been worsened because of climate change. The understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlaying plant pathogen interaction and defence responses is not only a fundamental scientific challenge, but it is also relevant to practical applications. Despite decades of research on host-pathogen interactions, knowledge on fundamental aspects of the plant immune system is still missing. This proposal provides an excellent opportunity to help filling this gap of knowledge as it targets the question of how cells translate molecular pathogen recognition into immune cell death, and how dying cells and their neighbours communicate to tightly control this process and ensure the proper balance in between defence responses and plant growth and fitness. To address this question, I have designed a multidisciplinary and international project using Arabidopsis thaliana plant as a model system to study the molecular determinants of plant immune cell death zonation and the involvement of plant metacaspases, distant relatives of animal caspases, in cell death. A plethora of techniques including molecular and biochemistry techniques, plant phenotyping and engineering, FACS and cell biology microscopy techniques will be used for the proper execution of this project. In addition to generate high-impact knowledge in plant immunity that will ultimately impact on society, this proposal will provide me with the expertise, resources, training, and network to become extremely competitive in the field of molecular plant pathology, helping me to progress in my scientific career and to achieve my scientific goals.', 'From wild to crop: unravelling the impact of root domestication on drought tolerance\nCrop domestication revolutionised human life. This process induced changes in plant traits that produced plants that grew faster and generated higher yields. However, remarkably little is known about how plant roots have changed throughout the domestication process. Climate change is causing increasing droughts in many parts of the world. Given that roots are the way that water enters the plant, they are key for understanding drought tolerance. Root traits from crop ancestors could offer a route to increasing drought tolerance of modern crops. To do this, we need to focus our efforts on the impact of domestication on roots and the rhizosphere (the zone around the root including microbes), rather than only aboveground traits as traditionally done. WILD-ROOTS will therefore test the overall hypothesis that crop domestication led to changes in root and rhizosphere traits which decreased the drought tolerance of crops compared to their wild relatives. WILD-ROOTS will make a holistic study of the roots and rhizospheres of a wide range of crops from diverse origins. There will be a focus on root exudation and volatile organic compound (VOC) emission, which are vital root processes that are crucial for many types of interactions with plants, animals, microbes and the soil itself. Changes in root exudates and VOCs have been observed during drought conditions, but their roles in the drought tolerance of plants remains unclear. WILD-ROOTS will (1) evaluate domestication effects on the roots and rhizosphere, then (2) elucidate the mechanisms relating belowground traits to drought tolerance, and finally (3) use this knowledge to modernise crop models and identify belowground traits to be exploited for drought-proofing current crops. The results will reshape our fundamental knowledge of both the crop domestication process and how root exudation influences drought tolerance, as well as offering new approaches to boost the food security of current and future agricultural systems.', 'LuxR solos as major proteobacterial players of cell-cell signaling in the plant microbiome\nMicrobes live as members of a microbial consortium where they interact with neighboring organisms (including their host) via the secretion of signaling molecules and through other types of cell-cell interactions. The root microbiome is comparable to the ’gut microbiome’ of the plant, important for optimal root growth, nutrition and providing resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses. The major mechanisms of microbial plant-recruitment from the soil and formation of microbial communities are unknown. The practical exploitation of these mechanisms will lead to innovative solutions for a sustainable agriculture, in order to mitigate the upcoming challenge associated with climate change. Main members of the root microbiome are Proteobacteria, as they account for 50% of the bacterial population, and LUXOM project aims to generate critical insights on their assembly and cell-cell communication mechanisms via a well-defined and targeted approach. LuxR solos, which evolved from cell-cell signaling quorum sensing systems (QS), are very widespread and exclusively found in proteobacteria. They are a family of transcriptional regulators that respond to endogenous or exogenous (also of plant origin) signals. The LuxR solos will be studied by genomics, genetics, molecular biology, analytical and molecular chemistry, biochemistry, microbiome analysis and state-of -the-art mass spectrometry based technologies. The importance of bacterial LuxR solos in the plant (root)-microbiome network will be explored to unravel their influence on plant host physiology and microbial community dynamics. Understanding cell-cell signaling in the root microbiome will be used to design bacterial communities of interacting plant-beneficial strains that will serve as a probiotic for plants to enhance plant health and sustainable agricultural productivity.

The role of brain rhythms has not been completely understood but evidence suggest that specific motor disorders may be linked to abnormal brain oscillations. Researching ways to modulate specific cortical motor rhythms could lead to discovering more effective approaches to treat patients with neurological disorders affecting their motor condition. However, our current understanding tools are insufficient to access and interact with this kind of neural activity. Non-invasive neuromodulation protocols such as transcutaneous Spinal Cord Stimulation (tSCS) are raising interest in recent years to induce changes in the Central Nervous System (CNS) that can lead to functional improvement, while the side effects and applicability limitations of invasive procedures are overcome. Better understanding the interaction between neuromodulation protocols and brain rhythms is crucial for the development of interventions targeting pathological circuits which can favour plastic changes and the restoration of impaired motor functions. In RhytMods, I will develop a non-invasive neuromodulation platform to apply closed-loop stimulation protocols synchronized with brain oscillations decoded from the periphery with muscle recordings (high-density electromyography, HD-EMG). The platform will allow to explore the modulatory effects of brain-oscillations-dependent stimulation of the CNS to treat motor symptoms and its potential to entrain and disrupt neural oscillations linked to motor recovery in patients with PD.

While EEG itself yields best data from neural tissue close to the skull, the US component is designed to deliver images from deeper brain regions.The second pillar of the devices function is focused US brain stimulation. Based on the possibility to localize abnormal activity, the neuromodulation component of the novel device can be guided to focal stimulation of selected brain regions, which can be further developed into a closed-loop design. The full envisioned system is a versatile tool that combines EEG-sensors and US transceivers in a wearable headset. The project foresees the development of hard- and software as well as algorithms to integrate the information from both modalities into functional neuroimaging with unpreceded spatiotemporal resolution.Beyond the technical realization, this project includes a proof of concept study to evaluate and demonstrate practical applicability in healthy participants and in patients with epilepsy, during clinical routine examination, cognitive, and sensory stimulation, including test-retest validation. The new device will reduce the time to examine and treat neurological patients and the cost thereof.

Furthermore, a large fraction of patients suffers from refractory (drug-resistant) epilepsy. Responsive electrostimulation is a state-of-the-art treatment for refractory epilepsy but is invasive and not cell-type selective. As a result, the surgery is susceptible to complications, e.g., haemorrhage and infection, and overstimulation due to false-positive epilepsy detection can cause brain region overactivity and even induce seizures. In contrast, ultrasound neuromodulation (UNMOD) is a recent, non-invasive and cell-type selective technique, that promises to pave the way for truly inhibitory protocols. The goal of this project is to design and optimize a first-of-its-kind minimally invasive closed-loop UNMOD treatment for refractory epilepsy. Acousto-electric heterodyning will be used to realize remote non-invasive hippocampal neurorecording. Subsequently, a controller will detect seizures and will trigger neuromodulatory insonication with a miniaturized subcutaneously implanted phased array. Moreover, an alternative non-invasive and closed-loop technology will be designed, for testing and patient selection before implantation. The main hurdle towards the realization of this disruptive treatment is our limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms of UNMOD and acoustic neurorecording. I intend to close this knowledge gap by developing an experimentally validated, comprehensive and morphologically-realistic computational framework of the ultrasound-sensitive hippocampal formation. Subsequently, this model will be used to optimize the insonication and recording protocols and to design the transducer and electrode arrays. This project concentrates on focal epilepsy, but the envisioned minimally- to non-invasive, cell-type specific, closed-loop technology with millimeter resolution, has the potential to revolutionize also the treatment of other brain and peripheral nerve disorders.']"

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) refers to the ability of microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites, to resist the effects of antimicrobial drugs, such as antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals, and antiparasitics. AMR is a serious global public health threat that could lead to increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs.World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared that AMR is one of the top 10 global public health threats facing humanity.  The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of AMR as it has led to increased use of antimicrobial drugs, particularly antibiotics, which can contribute to the development of AMR. People with COVID-19 may develop secondary bacterial infections, such as pneumonia, and may be prescribed antibiotics to treat these infections. However, unnecessary use of antibiotics can lead to the emergence and spread of resistant bacteria, making it more difficult to treat infections in the future.', ""PReclinical EVAluation and Investigation of  Laterocidamide - A novel antibiotic from a new drug class to overcome polymyxin resistance.\nThe emergence of Gram-negative bacterial resistance against antibiotics, especially the last-line-of-defense polymyxins, presents a societal threat with the potential to inflict higher healthcare costs and life-threatening patient risks. For decades, physicians have relied on polymyxins as a last line of defense to treat resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections that do not respond to standard antibiotic therapies. However, in 2016, a new polymyxin resistance mechanism surfaced: mobilized colistin resistance (MCR-1). The global overuse of antibiotics, including polymyxins, and a persistent lack of novel antibiotics have made us vulnerable to increased bacterial resistance, including the MCR-1 strains, seriously threatening our public health.   In Project PREVAIL, our group will validate the effectiveness of a novel drug, Laterocidamide (LATERO), from a new class of antibiotics to deliver an innovative solution that can mitigate the alarming global surge of antibiotic resistance. Our novel synthetic antibiotic, LATERO, has best-in-class potential to address these challenges with (i) minimal antimicrobial resistance, (ii) Gram-negative bacterial efficacy against polymyxin-resistant strains, and (iii) the ability to be produced at low cost. Moreover, our robust synthetic approach will allow us to generate additional analogs in the future. In PREVAIL, we will explore LATERO's technical and commercial potential. Specifically, we will validate LATERO as a novel antibiotic for (multi-drug-resistant) Gram-negative bacterial infections by performing in vitro and in vivo efficacy and preclinical toxicity studies. In parallel, we will: 1. Analyze the IP position and develop an IP rights strategy to protect LATERO and new analogs developed in the project to secure future assets. 2.

Emerging antibiotic resistance was usually overcome by treatment with new generation of antibiotics, but during last decades bacteria are clearly winning this race. Overuse of antibiotics, particularly in agriculture, and lack of investments in discovery of new antibiotics lead us to situation when increasing number of bacterial infections cannot be cured due to lack of effective remedy. Antibiotic resistance surveillance revealed rising antibiotic resistance around the world. WHO predicts that if no appropriate actions are taken by 2050 antibiotic resistance will be responsible even for 10 mln deaths every year. To address this urgent medical need new antibiotics and alternative methods of combating antibiotic resistant bacteria are needed. One of the new approaches which is getting more and more interests among academic and industrial research groups are enzybiotics, bacteriolytic enzymes that in a very effective and selective way eliminate bacteria, including antibiotic resistant strains, at the same time displaying very low resistance prevalence.

There is a high clinical demand for novel artificial intelligence (AI) tools which will facilitate risk stratification, early diagnosis, and disease progression assessment in HF. Such tools are essential to allow prompt initiation of evidence-based prevention and treatment strategies which will improve patient quality of life, reduce morbidity and mortality and the HF burden on healthcare.

IBD comprises diseases that are characterized by chronic inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract and includes ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD). These diseases are lifelong, causing debilitating symptoms and can be life-threatening. IBD is caused by an interplay between the patient’s genetic predisposition, immune responses and environmental factors. Chronic inflammation with fibrosis is the key driver of disease complications such as stenosis, abscess formation and colon cancer. IBD affects about 3.2 million people in Europe. IBD patients have an increased risk of CRC caused mainly by chronic intestinal inflammation leading to pro-neoplastic effects. In fact, IBD patients have an alarming 2- to 5- fold increased risk of developing CRC compared to the general population. Despite many treatment options, there is no cure for IBD. The IBD health economic burden in Europe is high and estimated at over 5B €/year. It is widely accepted that to overcome the challenges and to break through the “therapeutic ceiling” combination therapies or completely novel approaches will be needed. Due to the increasing incidence and prevalence and associated burden of IBD, the lack of effective long-term treatment options and the associated risks including CRC; IBD remains an important unmet medical need with an urgent need for novel therapies that can improve patient outcome. Here we will explore the use of a completely novel class of molecules exploiting a unique first-in-class mechanism-of-action and validate their efficacy as a therapeutic for IBD.

Despite its key relevance for a holistic understanding of the human superorganism and its (patho-)physiology, how local host-microbiome interactions form specific niches in the gut and how these niches function at the cellular and molecular level remains unexplored, mainly due to a lack of suitable technologies.To fill this gap, we propose to jointly reconstruct the host transcriptional and microbiome compositional landscape of the human gut across a large number of healthy individuals as well as IBD and CRC patients. For this, we will leverage a combination of novel spatial profiling technologies for unbiased transcriptome sequencing and microbiome profiling at single-cell resolution in situ. First, we will spatially delineate local niches formed of specific microbes and host cells. To dissect this complex crosstalk into specific interactions, we will secondly use in vitro and in vivo models to introduce perturbations either on the host or the microbiome side. Finally, we will integrate the resulting data to deconvolute host-microbiome circuits computationally and to predict functional niches, in particular host responses to pathogens of relevance in IBD and CRC. Interesting predictions will be tested in organoid and animal models. Developing a spatially resolved computational model of the gut ecosystem will allow us to predict early local events in disease onset; from these we will identify and validate prognostic IBD and CRC biomarkers for future clinical translation.This work will revolutionize our understanding of intestinal host-microbiome interactions by adding a first-ever functionally resolved spatial dimension with clinical relevance for the future diagnosis and treatment of intestinal disorders.', 'Impact Of The Gut Microbiota On Host Cells Energy Metabolism: Role In Health And In Inflammatory bowel disease\nInflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, are immune-related disorders characterized byinappropriate gut inflammation. Their incidence has increased dramatically in Western countries in recent decades, supporting a rolefor environmental factors. Despite the development of new treatments, IBD are insufficiently controlled in a large proportion ofpatients, inducing an alteration in quality of life and a socioeconomic burden. A better understanding of the pathogenesis andidentification of new therapeutic targets are therefore urgently needed. In this context, the gut microbiota has been recognized as astrong actor in IBD. Additionally, an alteration in intestinal and immune cell energy metabolism has been suggested in thepathogenesis. Classical host-microbe interaction concepts rely on the recognition of conserved microbial motifs by innate immunitysensors or on the action of microbial molecules on a host cell receptor. However, energy metabolism plays a crucial role in mountingthe appropriate cellular response, and emerging data indicate that the gut microbiota may directly affect it. I hypothesize that thealtered gut microbiota in IBD contributes to the impairment of host cell energy metabolism and pathogenesis. The aims ofENERGISED are to (i) identify the microorganisms and microbiota-derived metabolites impacting host cell energy metabolism and themechanisms involved and (ii) decipher the consequences of gut microbiota alterations on host cell energy metabolism in IBD anddesign new microbiota-based therapeutic strategies to manipulate the host cell energy state in IBD.This challenging project involves multidisciplinary aspects from microbiology to immunology, metabolism, and medicine; the use ofmultiple cutting-edge technologies; and translational analysis from mice to humans.

Therefore, there is an urgent need to better understand the molecular mechanisms behind AD in order to develop more effective treatments against this complex disease. Recent genetic findings have highlighted several AD-associated genes, many of which are preferentially expressed in microglia in the brain. One of these is tetraspanin 14 (TSPAN14), whose physiological function in the brain is not yet understood. Recent studies suggest that TSPAN14 may act as a functional regulator of ADAM10, a transmembrane protease that cleaves multiple substrates in the brain including the AD-associated protein TREM2. Full-length TREM2 is essential for the phagocytic activity of microglia and its cleavage by ADAM10 results in loss of function. The central aim of the TSPAN14-AD project is to understand how TSPAN14 controls molecular pathways involved in AD, by focusing on proteolysis and function of TREM2. Specifically, we hypothesize that TSPAN14 increases AD risk by modulation of TREM2 cleavage and microglial phagocytosis. The 3 objectives of TSPAN14-AD are to: (1) determine whether AD-protective TSPAN14 alternative splicing variants result in reduced TSPAN14 protein expression; (2) elucidate whether reduced TSPAN14 expression results in decreased ADAM10 cell surface expression; (3) assess whether loss of TSPAN14 reduces TREM2 cleavage and enhances phagocytic activity of microglia. To accomplish this, a combination of biochemical, molecular, and proteomic techniques will be used within both in vitro and in vivo models, including human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia and post-mortem human brain tissue. Outcomes of the project have the potential to fill in a large gap in our current understanding of molecular mechanisms leading to AD pathogenesis and may provide insight into novel therapeutic targets for AD and related disorders.', 'Novel biomarkers for improving diagnostics, prognostics, and treatments of Alzheimer’s disease\nAlzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and a major global health challenge. AD has a long pre-symptomatic phase spanning several decades. The accuracy of clinical AD diagnostics is mediocre, especially in primary care. This results in suboptimal treatment and care, which is especially problematic in light of emerging anti-amyloid therapies. ADVANCE-AD aims to revolutionize AD diagnostics and prognostics and fast-track the development of new effective therapies by using novel blood-based biomarkers forbeta-amyloid, tau, neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. First, my team will transform the clinical work-up of symptomatic AD patients globally by developing scalable, non-invasive and cost-effective diagnostic and prognostic algorithms based on novel blood-based biomarkers and digital tools.Second, disease-modifying therapies should be initiated already in the pre-symptomatic phase to be very effective. My team will therefore develop cost-effective diagnostic algorithms to identify AD pathology in individuals without cognitive symptoms, and prognostic algorithms to detect those most likely to develop symptoms and thereby benefit from new therapies. These new algorithms will then be used to recruit individuals into a pre-symptomatic trial-ready cohort to efficiently evaluate new anti-AD drugs.Third, new drug candidates for our trial-ready cohort will be identified using large-scale analyses of the novel AD-related biomarkers in biobanked longitudinal blood samples from already performed randomized placebo-controlled trials. Using this high risk/high-gain approach, we will evaluate if different classes of existing drugs (e.g. statins, GLP-1 agonists, anti-inflammatory agents) can halt development of AD and neurodegeneration. Finally, a novel genetic anti-tau treatment will be evaluated in this trial-ready cohort. ADVANCE-AD builds on world-leading research and will likely result in breakthroughs in early diagnostics and treatments for AD.', ""Window to the brain: a game changer in the discovery of human neuronal circuitry, cellular heterogenicity and biomarker profile indicative of early Alzheimer's disease -related pathology\nThe molecular mechanisms leading to Alzheimer's disease (AD) are poorly understood. This is due to lack of human tissue samples for research representing early changes of AD pathology. The accumulating pathology, including beta-amyloid and tau proteins, are manifested by concomitant neuroinflammatory reactions geared by malfunctional microglia. Microglia in the human and mouse AD brain exist in various subpopulations from which a specific, disease-associated microglia population is thought to be involved in AD pathogenesis. However, there is no evidence on whether and how these specific microglial subpopulations actually impair neuronal functions in human AD brain. I will now assess neuron-glia network activities and functions indicative of early AD pathology in humans. I hypothesize that early AD pathology selectively impairs neuronal circuits and that glial cells, especially specific microglia subpopulations, contribute to neuronal dysfunction and cognitive decline. These events contribute to a detectable vesicle-based biomarker profile in cerebrospinal fluid and blood prior the clinical disease. Due to early AD pathology present in a subpopulation of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) patients, the brains of the iNPH patients offer a unique window to evaluate cellular and molecular events occurring during early AD. I combine a series of state-of-the art techniques to answer how and what glial cell subpopulations are associated with altered neuronal network activities at subcellular and spatial resolution in human brain impacted by early AD-related pathology. Novel methodologies established in my lab, knowhow and access to unique brain samples make me uniquely positioned to form a holistic view on how early AD-pathology impacts cellular functions at multiple levels.

Therefore, a central question in developmental biology is how cells differentiate to acquire distinct fates. A combination of genetics, molecular biology, and microscopy approaches has led to fundamental discoveries. Recently, single-cell genomics has enabled the analysis of transcriptional differentiation trajectories at unprecedented scale and resolution. However, ordering single cells by transcriptome similarity only gives ensemble averages of differentiation trajectories and not the full spectrum of cell state transitions. It then remains unclear whether cells can commit to their fate at different stages of development or change differentiation trajectories. The sc-LAB2FATE project proposes to measure how single-cell transcriptomes change over time in living zebrafish embryos using a new RNA labelling methodology. This will reveal the full spectrum of differentiation trajectories during gastrulation, allowing to see not only the major routes of differentiation, but also rare alternative trajectories. Single-cell RNA labelling, biochemical nucleoside conversion and sequencing will be used to measure mRNA kinetics and transcriptome dynamics of zebrafish embryos at single-cell resolution. Spontaneous cell fate changes during normal development will be contrasted with induced cell fate changes upon cell transplantation from different cell types to decipher signalling interactions. This project will leverage single-cell genomics and traditional approaches in developmental biology to build a conceptual framework for analysing embryonic development as both a genetically programmed and a self-organised phenomenon, and to provide a general blueprint of how one can study perturbation response using metabolic labelling in living systems.', 'Designing synthetic regulatory domains to understand gene expression\nHow the genome controls precise, cell-type specific gene expression is crucial for cell identity and differentiation. Short cis-regulatory elements, such as enhancers, are distributed in extended regulatory domains surrounding their target gene, which in mammals typically span hundreds of kilobases. Although all evidence indicates that gene regulation is controlled by the combined action of large domains, our current understanding mostly focuses on enhancers. If and how intervening DNA sequences, enhancer order, or spacing within regulatory domains contribute to gene regulation is unknown. The reason for this largely unexplored aspect lies in our limited ability to systematically alter large genomic regions. In this study, we will use recent advances in synthetic biology to overcome this limitation. From synthetic DNA, we will create variants of entire gene regulatory domains and integrate these into mouse embryonic stem cells. We will test synthetic regulatory domain function in tailored gene expression analyses using cell culture, organoid, and in vivo models. By investigating regulatory elements with respect to their surrounding regulatory domain, we will uncover hidden rules of gene regulation.In variant regulatory domains we will systematically assay understudied parameters, such as enhancer spacing, order, or inter-enhancer sequences. We will use single-molecule methods to measure gene expression level; use organoid and in vivo systems to profile cell-type specific changes in expression patterns, and we will use the unique potential of synthetic DNA to understand the fundamental link between DNA sequence and chromatin composition of regulatory domains. With this interdisciplinary approach, we aim to uncover previously hidden layers of genomic information. The insights generated from this work will provide a novel and unique view on the organization of the non-coding genome, with the potential to expand our ability to read and write genomic DNA sequences.', 'Spatiotemporal analysis of mammalian embryonic development at single-cell level\nMammalian early embryonic development requires exquisite spatiotemporal gene regulation at the level of individual cells. However, it is still unclear and remains a fundamental challenge how cell behaviours govern gastrulation and organogenesis in early embryos. Two techniques have recently been developed to investigate cell fate decisions in early mammalian development (spatial transcriptomics at single-cell level) or to study the dynamic transition from single cells to fully formed organisms (in toto imaging), and if only these two techniques could be combined would we be able to link cell motion with cell state and more completely understand developmental processes. There is precedence for combining live cell imaging with gene expression data in ascidians and annelids, but this has yet to be done, at scale, in more complex mammalian systems. To this end, the proposal aims to investigate early mammalian development by linking spatial transcriptomics and in toto imaging data. This will be the first combination of real-time tracking of cellular dynamics and spatiotemporal gene expression profiles across the developing embryo, thus providing insight into how cells move, interact with each other and how they regulate their own gene expression, ultimately revealing the fate that cells adopt. Accordingly, I will develop a novel integration framework and generate the first cellular-resolution mammalian embryo developmental gene expression map in four dimensions that reflects both cellular dynamics and spatiotemporal gene expression profiles at the single-cell level. Moreover, this work will pave the way for multi-omics integration, which has been increasingly explored but to date is confined to the single-cell space.']"

However, over 60% of children with TB remain undiagnosed, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, which accounts for about 20% of the global burden of paediatric TB cases. In 2022, WHO issued an interim general recommendation to use integrated Treatment-Decision Algorithms (TDAs) to diagnose TB in children under 10 years. However, this recommendation was based on very low certainty of evidence. Therefore, we are seeking funding to address four objectives: 1) To compare the effectiveness of TDAs and the Standard of Care in routine clinical settings 2) To identify processes and contextual factors that influence the effectiveness and fidelity in the implementation of TDAs 3) To compare the costs, cost-effectiveness, and the population level impact of the TDA strategies on the burden of TB and 4) To validate the diagnostic performance (sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values) of the TDAs in various health system settings and clinical context. A four-year pragmatic open-label cluster randomized controlled trial will be conducted in 120 primary health facilities in Tanzania, Uganda, and DR Congo. The primary outcome is the proportion of children detected and initiated on TB treatment. About 60,000 children with presumptive TB will be screened. We anticipate that this project will yield results that address the issue of low detection rates of paediatric TB in sub-Saharan Africa and beyond, build research capacity in conducting implementation research in low-income countries, and foster networking and collaboration between the partner institutions.']"

Cardiac tissue engineering solutions that can improve the quality of life of those with advanced heart disease have proved challenging so far. Bioprinting is an exciting technology that holds promise to fabricate tissues and organs. Lab-grown engineered cardiac muscle requires at least four weeks to maturate in a bioreactor. In LIGHTHEART, an off-the-shelf solution will be developed for treating injured myocardium in vivo. An unconventional combination of bioprinting and optogenetics will be used to surgically fabricate engineered cardiac muscle directly at the patient’s heart. A surgical bioprinting tool will be constructed to achieve vascularization and cellular architectures as that observed in native cardiac muscle. Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac cells will be the basis of the bioinspired biomaterial-free ink that will be printed. Optogenetic expression of different light-sensitive proteins at the cell surfaces will be the sole trigger of cellular assembly, thus omitting the need to embed cells in hydrogels or printing in a supporting bath.

There are no effective therapies for heart failure that regenerate the damaged heart muscle following injury such as a myocardial infarction. The adult mammalian heart has an extremely limited intrinsic capacity for regeneration due to the fact that mature cardiomyocytes are unable to proliferate. To date, attempts to re-induce proliferation in mature cardiomyocytes of the adult heart have not yet been translated into the human clinical context. Much remains to be learned about molecular mechanisms controlling cardiomyocyte proliferation in humans if the therapeutic potential for cardiac regeneration is to be realised. With my extensive training and expertise in molecular and stem cell biology I plan to generate and exploit an innovative live cell cycle reporter-based screening platform to identify Transcription Factors (TFs) that can be induce cardiomyocyte proliferation. The three major objectives of this research proposal are: 1. Develop a high-content screening system to monitor cardiomyocyte proliferation in 3D human cardiac organoids, which will then be used to:2. Identify (combinations of) TFs that drive the human cardiomyocyte cell cycle.3. Assess the therapeutic potential of TF activation for cardiac regeneration in a pre-clinical human cardiac model system.

Among these, most cardiovascular diseases, such as myocardial infarction, lead to the formation of heart scarring, which is the formation of fibrotic tissue that impairs contractility and cardiac function, ultimately causing heart failure. Despite the prevalence and serious consequences of heart fibrosis, current benchmark therapies have low long-term efficacy, and alternative novel therapies that have reached clinical testing still present severe limitations or lead to little improvement in cardiac function. Thus, there is still an urgent unmet need for the development of novel and efficient therapies for cardiac fibrosis. Cutting-edge research regarding the use of stem cells or delivery of molecules to induce cardiomyocyte proliferation are yet to be successful, as most of these therapies present challenges regarding immunogenicity, efficiency, and long-lasting effect. Thereby, MyoNanoCell project aims at developing a radically new platform for heart fibrosis and cardiac regeneration. By using a combinatory approach, where the MyoNanoCell nanohybrids incorporate not only the ability to carry different cardiomyogenic molecules, but also the ability to modulate the cardiac microenvironment and recognize cardiac fibroblasts, MyoNanoCell will radically increase therapeutic efficiency. Moreover, the simultaneous modulation of cardiac microenvironment and its repopulation with cardiomyocytes by fibroblast reprogramming will directly impact contractility and heart function, representing a paradigm shift in cardiac fibrosis therapy. MyoNanoCell will be fully characterized in vitro to have a full biological fingerprint on the process of cell identity shift, and also tested in advanced 3D in vitro models, to evaluate its overall effects at tissue level.']"

The pathogenesis of NAFLD is clearly linked to metabolic alterations, and is primarily characterized by excessive hepatic triglyceride content. Over time, metabolic dysfunction induces hepatic inflammation through mechanisms that remain poorly understood. This advanced disease stage, called non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), significantly raises the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, cardiovascular disease and type-2 diabetes. My recent work has helped demonstrate that: 1) changes in conventional dendritic cell (cDC) populations in liver are closely associated with the development and the resolution of NASH in humans, and 2) extracellular metabolites can modulate cDC cytokine production and responses by rewiring their intracellular metabolic programs. Together, these studies indicate that alterations of the local hepatic metabolite environment could affect cDC function and thereby drive NASH pathogenesis.cDCs coordinate innate and adaptative immunity through cytokine secretion and antigen presentation. However, their role in NAFLD pathophysiology not well defined. In this ambitious multidisciplinary project, my objective is to systematically dissect the immuno-metabolic programs and functions of hepatic cDC during NASH progression and regression. First, we will identify disease-associated cDC subpopulations and their intracellular metabolic programs. We will then determine whether these cDC subtypes associate with specific local metabolic microenvironments in the liver in relation to histological features of NAFLD. Finally, we will determine how metabolic manipulation of cDC affects their immune function in the context of NASH. The present proposal has the potential to radically transform our understanding of NASH pathophysiology by delineating the specific links between metabolic dysfunction and innate immunity in liver disease.', 'Adipose tissue-Liver Macrophage CrossTalk in NASH and Fibrosis\nNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by hepatic steatosis and damage. This drives liver inflammation, promoting the progression to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and liver fibrosis. There are currently no approved therapies for NASH and fibrosis, which is in part due to a lack of knowledge of the immunological events underpinning NASH and fibrosis. The pathogenesis of NASH is strongly influenced by crosstalk with other tissues. There is increasing evidence that specifically obese adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) are directly linked to liver pathology. In this respect, the host lab has shown that obese ATMs increase hepatic macrophage number. However, the exact changes in macrophage subsets and phenotypes were not investigated. I recently demonstrated that in NASH liver macrophages display large heterogeneity in phenotype and tissue localization and this plays a key role in NASH-associated liver fibrosis. Based on this combined preliminary data generated by the host lab and me, I hypothesize that ATMs alter hepatic macrophage composition and consequently affect the progression of NASH to liver fibrosis. By combining the mouse models and expertise available in the host lab and advanced technology present at the host institute, with my expertise in detailed immunophenotyping of the liver in NASH and fibrosis, I will address this innovative hypothesis in great detail. To bridge the translational gap from animal studies, I will investigate the potential contribution of ATMs to hepatic inflammation and fibrosis in humans by using unique fresh paired adipose tissue and liver biopsies available through the clinical network of the host lab. MacTalk integrates the scientific and technical expertise of both me and the host lab, creating a unique framework to identify novel mediators of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis. Furthermore, MacTalk will lay a strong foundation for my future career as independent researcher in the field of liver fibrosis.', 'Unravelling the pathogenic cell-cell circuits underlying the tissue memory of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease\nWith the obesity epidemic, global prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is currently at 25% and rising. NAFLD results from accumulation of excessive fat in the liver and covers a spectrum of disease states from simple steatosis (fatty liver) to severe non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NAFLD patients are also at increased risk of developing secondary pathologies, including infections and paracetamol-induced liver damage, although the mechanisms behind this remain unclear. As no pharmacological treatment of NAFLD exists to date, patients are typically instructed to lose weight as this can alleviate symptoms. However, with the recent proposal of tissue memory of inflammation, including NAFLD, it is unclear if weight loss alone is sufficient to restore liver homeostasis or if recovered NAFLD patients remain more susceptible to secondary inflammatory events. Recently, the host labs have identified key cell-cell circuits that control the functional specialization of liver resident macrophages in the steady-state and fatty liver. These findings led me to hypothesize that NAFLD could lead to tissue memory by disrupting the interactions between resident liver cells and establish aberrant cell-cell circuits that maintain a pathological state even after weight loss. Furthermore, I postulate that this NAFLD memory could facilitate the relapse into NAFLD but also modulate susceptibility to secondary insults. Indeed, my preliminary data indicates altered susceptibility to paracetamol overdose.  Here, I propose to use single-cell RNA sequencing and epigenetics to investigate how cell-circuits in the liver are perturbed after NAFLD regression and identify the signals underlying these alterations. This project will further our understanding on how liver circuits are distorted in disease and could provide therapeutic avenues to ‘reset’ pathogenic liver circuits in patients currently suffering from NAFLD or those in the process of weight loss and recovery.']"

A significant part of our visual stimulations is however generated by our own actions, rather than external events. For example, the retina can experience similar visual stimulus driven by head-movement, or by a moving object. Therefore, self-motion related information is fundamental to contextualize visual stimuli. In other words, what the eye sees may not be what our brain perceives depending on our actions. In mammals, the vestibular system reports both the motion and orientation of the head. Very little is known about the pathways connecting the vestibular system to visual cortical areas, and how this signal is integrated with external visual stimuli to ultimately impact behaviour. The goal of this project is to unravel the neuronal circuits underlying visual processing during self-motion in mice, thereby providing new insights in sensory processing. To this aim, I will address the following questions: 1) What is the long-range and local connectivity of neurons modulated by head rotation in V1; 2) What are the circuit mechanisms and neuronal computations involved in the integration of self-motion related signals with visual inputs in V1; 3) How do head motion inputs to V1 influence visually-guided actions during behaviour. Achieving these goals relies on a multidisciplinary experimental strategy based on cutting-edge approaches to monitor and control circuit activity with high spatio-temporal resolution in a cell-type specific manner, neuroanatomical tracing, and computational modelling. This experimental strategy combined with my research background in visual and vestibular systems provides a unique opportunity to understand unexplored aspects of sensory processing, at both the cellular and systems levels.

A closed loop approach to link neural activity to mouse behavior.\nA paramount component of intelligence is our ability to extract useful information in the world through our sensory observations. Object recognition is a fundamental problem in visual perception: every day we depend on our ability to identify objects in our visual environment, and our brain is capable of accomplishing it effortlessly and in a fraction of a second, in spite of immense variation in the sensory information that arrives in our retinas. Understanding the algorithm that the brain uses to do this complex task is a decisive conquest in neuroscience but in order to understand ethologically relevant visual processing, we need to understand how it drives behavior. Despite significant progress characterizing visual processing, we do not understand how the visual system solves visual inference problems in natural environments and we are still far from having a complete understanding of how the brain creates untangled transformation-invariant object representations in the perceptual/visual domain, that can subsequently be used to guide behavior. The proposed research effort aims to (i) create a state-of-the-art behavioral virtual navigation system for mice, (ii) combine it with recent advanced functional brain recording techniques and sophisticated neural data analysis to study how objects are represented in the activity of large populations of neurons across the visual hierarchy and beyond and (iii) causally relate these representations to the behavior of the animal. The outcomes of this project will provide significant insights into the computations used by the mouse visual cortex to extract relevant features from the environment, identify how distinct features are represented across the mouse visual areas and how in turn these representations guide the behavior of the animals.', 'Tracing Visual Computations from the Retina to Behavior\nEvery second, millions of bits of information enter our eyes. How does the brain identify task-relevant information from this gigantic input stream? This key challenge of the visual system is tackled by substantially processing the sensory input for behavioral relevance. Already in the retina, the front-end of the visual system, neuronal circuits extract multiple features from the environment and form up to 40 channels to the brain. So far, however, one of the basic principles underlying vision, namely how the brain processes these multiple channels from the eye, remains fundamentally unclear.In this proposal, I will focus on the superior colliculus, an evolutionary conserved retino-recipient brain area critically involved in visuomotor transformations, and solve the following problem: How do neuronal circuits in mouse superior colliculus integrate retinal signals to drive behavior? I will implement an interdisciplinary approach that combines population imaging of neuronal activity in behaving mice with optogenetic manipulations, deep neural network modeling, and quantitative behavioral analysis. By modeling a defined brain area all the way from the retinal input to its role in behavior in an ecological setting, I will mechanistically dissect the behavioral relevance of retinal circuits.My work will uncover general principles of how diverse retinal channels are represented in downstream targets, identify elemental convergence rules of feedforward retinal signals in postsynaptic neurons, and causally link retinal function to distinct behaviors. If successful, my proposal will reveal fundamental neuronal and computational mechanisms used by the visual system to convert a complex visual input into action. My approach can be adapted to other sensory modalities, guiding the design of innovative experiments and analyses. The identified mechanisms of efficient information processing will also contribute to the development of robust neuro-inspired artificial intelligence.']"

The progress regarding sensitive, robust, fast, and cost-effective biosensors is a very active research field. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy is a powerful technique for ultrasensitive label-free analysis of chemical and biological samples with wide applicability, vastly demonstrated for cancer.  Nevertheless, translation of SERS to the clinics and industry is limited due to the lack of reproducible substrates and automation routines to analyze complex spectra.    Liquid biopsy is the most commonly used practice for clinical preliminary disease screening. Some groups have already shown noteworthy work addressing the potential of SERS in blood plasma and urine, making it suitable for rapid and minimally invasive cancer diagnosis. SERS can be applied to sense subtle changes in composition and structure of biomolecules in plasma/urine from cancer subjects. Allied to this, discriminant analysis models (DAM)  have been applied to SERS. These studies demonstrate that a powerful diagnostic system can be built for cancer screening with very high specificity and sensitivity.The main objective of SIREN is the development of a liquid biopsy test on which highly sensitive solid SERS substrates will detect changes in biomolecular profile between cancer and no cancer samples.

Information about these mechanisms is present however in the blood. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are secreted into the blood, and can inform us about the state of their cells of origin, and by extension, about the presence and progression of diseases. Unfortunately, their detection is still imperfect due to the ultra-small size (50-200 nm) of most of them. PHOREVER will develop a disruptive multi-sensing platform that will enable for the first time the reliable detection of EVs with size down to 80 nm, the detection of EVs with specific biomarkers (proteins) on their surface, and the calculation of the corresponding EV concentrations in the blood. Its operation will be based on 3 sensing modalities: Flow-cytometry (FCM) with 4 wavelengths (405, 488, 633 and 785 nm) as the main modality for EV detection and size classification, dual-channel swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) with 2.5 µm resolution for imaging of the sensing area and noise reduction of the FCM measurements, and fluorescence sensing at 488 nm for biomarker detection after staining. The key components will be the 2 photonic integrated circuits in TriPleX and the 3 microfluidic chips, which will be integrated as a compact point-of-care device.

The second use case will be related to stroke with focus on its fast and precise diagnosis for time-to-treatment reduction. In either case, data analysis empowered by artificial intelligence will correlate the measurement data to disease specific medical information.', 'Exosome Characterization Platform for Early Detection of Breast Cancer\nBreast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide. Early detection is the most critical element, as the survival rate increases by up to 99%.

Sensitive, non-invasive, and easy-to-use liquid biopsy techniques will revolutionize cancer diagnosis and treatment monitoring. The goal of this project is to develop a complete platform for the isolation and label-free optical characterization of biological nanoparticles called exosomes extracted from blood. Exosomes are secreted from the cells into the body fluids and play an important role in intercellular communication. These particles are emerged as potential biomarkers for liquid biopsy applications, as they carry information about their original cell. However, the translation of exosome-based analyses from research labs to clinical settings is limited due to the lack of efficient isolation and quantification tools available. We aim to develop a novel exosome characterization platform, named multimodal Interferometric-Raman imaging platform to detect and quantify exosomes at a single-particle level without using any labels.

At present, more than two-thirds of prescription drugs contain at least one chiral center. However, the late-stage introduction of this structural motif using aromatic C–H bonds is an enduring challenge in synthesis. The goal of the NAKED-C project is to develop a new methodology for the construction of chiral centers in drug molecules, relying on the design and synthesis of a novel class of atomic carbon precursors that, upon successive and appropriate activations, would allow to build tailored asymmetric carbons. To achieve this goal, a new visible-light photoredox catalytic diazomethylation of aromatic C–H bonds will be developed. The collaboration with an industrial partner (secondment at AiCuris) will allow the application of this novel strategy to drug discovery in the search of effective antibiotics, thus merging multidisciplinary aspects with intersectoral knowledge transfer. The result will be a brand-new ‘assembly point’ for the construction of chiral centers in bioactive compounds, with the potential to become a late-stage diversity-generating synthetic platform for drug discovery programs. The proposal merges the host expertise in novel C−H functionalization strategies based on photocatalysis, and the researcher’s background in classical radical chemistry, metal-mediated synthesis and pharmacology, ensuring the two-way transfer of knowledge between the fellow and the host group.

Among these chiral molecules, β2-amino acids and their derivatives are highly demanding chemicals because of their extensive uses in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals. My SYNERGISTIC proposal will envisage the functionalization of challenging alkenes  and CO2 to achieve chiral β2-amino acids under energy-efficient photocatalytic conditions. To achieve this chemistry, I propose a novel approach by employing two different catalysts to activate simultaneously the double bond of alkene and to insert CO2 into the double bond.  I will use a metal-free photocatalyst in combination with a halogen atom transfer (XAT) reagent to activate the double bond of alkene, and a homogeneous chiral transition metal complex to insert the CO2 molecule in a face-selective way. The mild reaction conditions of photoredox catalysis should enable to functionalize a wide range of alkenes as well as for late-stage functionalization of ‘functionally challenging’ molecules found in natural products and complex pharmaceuticals. This proposal will significantly contribute to the advancement of the ‘CO2-valorization’ blueprint as well as will create a groundbreaking ‘green approach’ for the synthesis of chiral  β2-amino acids using CO2 as a C1 synthon. More importantly, the fundamental new insights of this novel catalytic system that will be gained during this investigation will be a game-changer for the enhancement of sustainable chemistry.', 'Enabling the direct synthesis of multi-functionalized iodoarenes as accessible sophisticated building blocks for sustainable catalytic sequences\nIn the last 20 years, palladium-catalyzed C–H activation has emerged as a useful alternative to traditional cross-coupling methods and a powerful tool to access valuable intermediates for the synthesis of complex functional molecules. The biaryl fragment is one of the most frequent units present in bioactive molecules, functional organic materials and natural products. Despite major advances, significant limitations persist with regard to their preparation, in term of reactivity, selectivity and sustainability. Based on the recent achievements in the synthesis of ortho-iodobiaryls following a Catellani strategy, the overall objective of this proposal is the development of a general and sustainable method for the direct synthesis of ortho-iodobiaryls and selectively substituted haloarenes as valuable intermediates for the synthesis of a large number of high value-added compounds. The project aims also to develop protocols for the straightforward synthesis of new biaryl-containing phosphines, as a valuable application of this methodology. CAT4Arene will allow the selective construction of halogenated biaryls and arenes which can be further easily converted into a broad variety of high value-added compounds. In particular, thanks to the easily manipulation of the C-halogen bond, especially C-I and C-Br bonds, these new methodologies will unlock the direct construction of tricky molecular architectures, including biaryl-containing phosphines and bioactive nitrogen derivatives. Likewise, new classes of organic molecules would be also accessed, unlocking the opportunity to enlarge the range of compounds available for the medicinal chemistry and the agrochemical industry. The development of unconventional haloarenes formation protocols will be an outstanding breakthrough for the organic chemistry community.']"

Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents a significant global health challenge as the population ages at an accelerating pace. A key pathological feature of AD is the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated Tau, which disrupts normal neuronal function. Emerging evidence suggests that Tau undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), potentially linking AD and biomolecular condensation. Moreover, recent findings propose that LLPS intricately manages kinase signalling, creating condensed-phase structures (biomolecular condensates) that serve as recognizable sites for kinases. However, molecular mechanisms governing kinase behaviour within condensates are poorly understood. The central hypothesis of KinCond project is that the conformational landscape of protein kinases undergoes significant remodelling within biomolecular condensates, controlling substrate selectivity and specificity. This project focuses on the microtubule affinity-regulating kinase MARK2, a central player in the abnormal phosphorylation of Tau. KinCond is meticulously structured into three work packages: (1) investigating the specificity and reaction kinetics of MARK2 within Tau condensates, (2) deciphering the conformational landscape of MARK2 through advanced nuclear magnetic resonance methods and molecular dynamics simulations and (3) analyse the effect of biomolecular condensation on the conformational landscape of MARK2. The outcomes of KinCond are expected to provide crucial insights into the behaviour of protein kinases within biomolecular condensates, shedding much-needed light on the mechanisms of Tau phosphorylation in AD. Furthermore, the atomic-detail information obtained has the potential to open new avenues for the development of enhanced drugs targeting protein kinases."", 'Deciphering Neurodegenerative Disease with fast 3D imaging & functional nanoscopy\nNeurodegenerative diseases are incurable, progressive brain disorders associated with accumulation of aberrant protein aggregates with severe effects on movement and mental functioning. The mechanism leading to neurotoxicity is far from understood, due to our lack of insight into early processes. Recently, aberrant liquid-liquid phase separation has emerged as a new concept to explain protein aggregation in neurodegenerative disease. Here, I will investigate the biophysical basis of the formation of different material states of aggregates, by capitalizing on my expertise at the interface of single-molecule biophysics and quantitative, high-resolution imaging in cells.I propose to address the following key questions, with the use of cellular models of Huntington’s Disease (HD) complemented with well-controlled in vitro experiments: How do the physico-chemical properties of protein variants and the cellular environment influence aggregation and toxicity? What role does phase separation play in Huntington’s disease? How does prion-like spreading of extracellular protein interfere with local protein assemblies in cells? HD is caused by a gene defect resulting in aggregation-prone huntingtin protein. The diverse sizes (nm-μm) and conformations of the aggregates pose a remarkable challenge, and multiple complementary approaches are needed to unravel their morphology and physico-chemical properties. I will develop multimodal AI-informed quantitative microscopy and functional nanoscopy to decipher how aggregates in neurodegenerative disease form and mature. Importantly, we will work without tags and exploit virtually stained quantitative phase imaging to assess mechanical properties and cell pathophysiology, therefore minimizing interference with aggregation processes. The QScope project is expected to elucidate the role of protein aggregation and phase transitions, relevant for a broad variety of diseases, and to establish new label-free and super-resolution imaging.', ""Understanding the molecular basis of protein folding disorders and protein quality control in muscle\nMutations in certain proteins can cause their misfolding and aggregation, posing a potential threat to the health of an organism. Protein aggregation is counteracted by protein quality control (PQC) mechanisms that reduce the amounts of damaged molecules. As we age, however, the crucial surveillance mechanisms weaken and become less effective, leading to protein misfolding diseases. The most well-known protein disorders, or proteinopathies – Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and Parkinson's diseases – are characterized by the formation of toxic protein aggregates, known as amyloids. Current research focuses on such amyloid diseases, however, there seem to be many other, hidden protein disorders. In principle, every mutation in a protein can affect its folding and stability and may become pathological only when PQC mechanisms are compromised. To better understand this kind of proteinopathy, we will generate novel PQC tools and study muscle protein disorders in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We will design dual-colour fluorescent protein reporters to monitor the misfolding and aggregation of disease-linked myosin variants, our model proteins. The ‘MyoState’ library, comprising hundreds of mutants with a broad range of folding defects, will allow us to study the pathological impact of individual myopathy mutations and investigate cellular rescue mechanisms. In C. elegans, myosin disease mutations cause characteristic defects in motility and muscle structure, which can be rescued by dietary restriction. This animal model thus provides us with a unique opportunity to perform genome-wide screens that will define the PQC network in muscle cells. By performing structural and functional analyses of key factors in this network, we aim to reveal the fundamental mechanisms of myosin quality control and its regulation. Our ultimate goal is to understand how the misfolding of functional proteins, whether due to mutation or age, impairs cell function.""]"

Viral infection is a complex multistep process involving both the virus and the host cell machinery. The very first stage consists of landing and binding of the virus, followed by host cell entry, and then the release of the viral genetic material into the cell. Entry pathways are largely defined by the preliminary interactions between viruses and their receptors at the cell interface. Elucidating this complex interplay is a crucial step towards establishing a full picture of the infection process and may lead to the discovery of new antiviral drugs targeting viral entry.Our current knowledge of virus-host interactions mainly relies on the use of cancerous model cell lines cultured in 2D that far from mimic the 3D in vivo conditions of tissue, such as cell heterogeneity and complex organization. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop an innovative platform to monitor and quantify the molecular forces and dynamics at play during the entry pathways in such complex environments. The ambition of this proposal is to unravel virus-host interactions under physiologically relevant 3D conditions by combining single-virus atomic force microscopy and optical tweezer techniques. By means of cellular models of increasing complexity, we will decipher the complex relationship between the organization and heterogeneity of epithelium and the early stages of viral infection. At the frontiers of nanobiophysics and virology, this project will push the limits of advanced nanotechniques to understand the molecular mechanisms of virus entry in unprecedented 3D in vivo conditions.This project will have strong scientific and medical impacts. In virology, it will strongly enhance our molecular understanding of virus-host interactions. In medicine, our new methodology will contribute to the identification of new compounds that target viral infection and the innate immune response.', 'Dynamics and heterogeneity of early viral infection\nViruses are simple replicative units built from two components: a nucleic acid and a small number of associated proteins. Upon entering a cell, viruses co-opt the hosts machineries to copy their genetic material, while shutting down the hosts antiviral immune response. The success of viral infection differs dramatically from cell to cell through poorly understood mechanisms, resulting in heterogenous propagation through tissues, and ultimately, heterogeneous disease progression.Although viruses have been studied for decades, the earliest steps of cellular infection have remained hidden, because only a few viral molecules are present at this stage, which presents formidable challenges for molecular analyses. Yet these initial events are critical for achieving a successful infection; transcription, translation and replication must be perfectly balanced to rapidly scale virus production before antiviral signalling pathways are activated. To overcome this barrier, we recently developed a first-in-kind imaging technology for simple positive-sense single stranded RNA (+ssRNA) viruses that transforms our ability to visualize early viral infection processes. In this proposal, we will expand our single–molecule toolbox to gain molecular insights into early viral infection of the more complex group of negative-sense RNA (-ssRNA) viruses. We will focus on the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a -ssRNA virus which can be deadly in infants and vulnerable adults, and lacks effective treatments. Specifically, we will determine i) how viral transcription and replication are coordinated on single viral genomic RNA molecules to optimize early viral propagation, ii) what causes the early viral infection heterogeneity, and iii) how heterogeneity in early viral infection impacts infection outcome. Using our novel approaches, we will gain a deep understanding of viral biology, which will eventually inform therapeutic interventions.', ""Interrogating RNA-protein interactions underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection and antiviral defense\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic underscores the need to better understand its causative agent, SARS-CoV-2, and the various other emerging viruses threatening human health. Like many human viruses, SARS-CoV-2 utilizes RNA as its replicated genetic material and its template for translating the virus's proteins. Ongoing research into SARS-CoV-2 and other RNA viruses has largely focused on understanding the function of their encoded proteins, revealing key roles in host cell entry, viral replication, and immune suppression. In contrast, little is known about the set of viral RNAs and how they interact with host machinery as part of a virus's replication cycle in infected cells. My group discovered a large collection of viral and host proteins that bind the genomic and subgenomic RNAs of SARS-CoV-2 during infection. This collection provides an excellent starting point to work toward the goal of my proposed ERC Starting Grant project: decoding how these interactions shape the viral RNA life cycle and contribute to antiviral defense mechanisms. My overarching hypothesis is that SARS-CoV-2 dynamically modulates RNA-protein interactions in the host to facilitate functions of genomic and subgenomic viral RNAs at different stages of the replication cycle. To test this hypothesis, I have devised three research objectives:    1) Decode mechanisms of host-mediated control over the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs.  2) Map with temporal resolution which host cell proteins engage each SARS-CoV-2 RNA type.  3) Elucidate the role of host proteins that moonlight as RNA binders in SARS-CoV-2 infections.    If successful, this project will identify novel pro- and antiviral host factors in SARS-CoV-2 infections and reveal underlying RNA regulatory mechanisms. In turn, these insights will provide an RNA-centric view of viral infections and identify candidate factors and pathways as therapeutic targets to treat viral diseases.""]"

The problem is exacerbated when treating cancers that are either deep down inside the human body, or in delicate areas where toxicity to nearby organs could cause serious side effects, especially when treating obese patients, whose numbers are increasing globally. Thus, an accessible and cost-effective alternative to current RT modalities is urgently needed.   In ERC-PoC project Vherapy we made a breakthrough in demonstrating the viability of delivering high-quality particle beams with compact laser plasma accelerators for very high energy electron radiotherapy (VHEE-RT). We demonstrated that such a VHEE beam can be produced with a single laser beam using a new injection scheme, making the acceleration machinery small, simple and cost effective, thereby giving this device of the future substantial competitive advantage. The objectives of the eBeam4Therapy project are to optimize VHEE beam performances for radiotherapy applications further, to characterise the 3D dose deposition, to improve and scale-down each component of the machine, and finally to build a machine prototype that demonstrates the technical feasibility in an economically competitive setting.   The commercial feasibility is validated with real market players and the project expands the existing network of collaborators and sources additional investment to accomplish the next steps in technological & commercial development to speed up market entry. eBeam4Therapy aims to revolutionise cancer therapy by providing better clinical outcomes and radically improving the quality of life of cancer patients at a lower financial burden to payers and economies, thus addressing a real and immediate global societal challenge.', 'Towards ultra-high dose rates in proton therapy: an ionoacoustic approach for in vivo dose monitoring\nThe use of ultra-high dose rates (FLASH) in radiation therapy has emerged as a promising modality to treat cancer due to its unprecedented ability to reduce healthy tissue toxicity while ensuring tumor control. “Towards ultra-high dose RAtes in Proton therapy: an Ionoacoustic approach for in vivo Dose monitoring” (RAPID) project aims at providing new insights into the clinical benefits of proton FLASH radiotherapy by resolving the challenge of real-time dose monitoring. The action represents a powerful instrument to push the boundaries of cancer care with proton radiotherapy at three different levels: i) the optimization of an ionoacoustic imaging system for real-time pulse-based 3D dose monitoring, ii) the experimental evaluation of the physical requirements to achieve the FLASH effect by in vivo and in vitro studies under different beam conditions, and iii) the interpretation and optimization of the ionoacoustic signal response for different treatment plans. The ionoacoustic imaging technique, combined with an ultrasound system, will enable to image simultaneously tissue morphology and dose deposition of the beam. These technological advances will disentangle the complex and multiple variables influencing the yet unknown FLASH effect, as well as enabling the first systematic study combining FLASH dosimetry and tissue damage/toxicity response.

According to the latest research, 20% of people will develop cancer at some point during their lifetime. Radiotherapy (RT) is the medical use of ionizing radiation to treat cancer. About 52% of cancer patients receive RT at least once during their treatment. During the last years, new RT treatment modalities are rapidly being researched, one of the most promising is the Ultra High Dose-Rate Radiotherapy (UHDR) or FLASH therapy, where the delivered dose rate is several orders of magnitude higher than the conventional one. This approach has been found to elicit significant sparing of healthy tissues with equal probability of tumor control. One of the challenges to validate and enable the clinical implementation of FLASH is the development of active dosimetry systems that allow accurate dose measurements and beam monitoring. The experience gained in RT traditional treatments shows that secondary neutrons can produce a not insignificant undesirable parasitic dose to healthy tissue and critical organs that can induce late effects. Therefore, the measurement of neutron flux and its spectrum is key to determining potential risks in FLASH therapy.  The goal of this project is the development of a novel matrix of active neutron dosimeters based on Silicon Carbide (SiC) diodes covered with different types of neutron conversion layers and moderators for characterizing the neutron contribution out-of-field in FLASH conditions.  SiC has many advantages, e.g., low noise, insensitivity to visible light and temperature variations, higher radiation hardness than silicon. The host group has been the first worldwide in obtaining a SiC detector with a linear relationship between the charge collected and the dose  up to 11 Gy/pulse (1.5 um pulse). To the best of our knowledge, there are no active neutron dosimeters to measure out-of-field neutron doses in FLASH conditions. We propose to create the first one in the field.']"

Multi-metabolite monitoring will also lead to a diabetes therapy breakthrough by algorithmically driving a continuous physiologic insulin delivery by a maintenance-free implanted MEMS pump using the peritoneal route enabling an optimal therapy for subjects with ITD.Our vision is a fully implantable artificial organ to replace insulin secretion loss by targeting metabolic health instead of mere glucose control and mimicking physiological insulin action. While offering a really burden-free life for insulin-treated children and adults, it is expected to allow a dramatic reduction of metabolic variations, hence a minimization of acute and long-term complications and an abating of the still high mortality of T1D patients.Unobtrusive living with diabetes will be reached by the calibration-free, implantable, long-term multi-metabolite monitoring solution connected wirelessly to a novel highly miniaturized silicon MEMS micropump, with down to 50 nl stroke volume, able to operate a newly developed U1000 insulin and enabling reservoir refill cycles of 180 days up to 365 days.

Early or intensive insulin therapy maintains residual β-cell function, but also causes weight gain and hypoglycaemia. Thus, currently no drug treatment can safely stop the progression of diabetes, a disease characterized by loss or dysfunction of insulin-producing β-cells.In breakthrough discoveries we identified the insulin inhibitory receptor (inceptor) as a druggable target for β-cell insulin sensitization and protection without the side-effects of insulin. Moreover, we combined GLP-1-mediated safe β-cell delivery of estrogen together with 60% reduced insulin therapy to restore β-cell function for diabetes remission. The overarching goal of BetaRegeneration is to explore new avenues of targeted and combinatorial β-cell protection and regeneration therapy.In Aim 1 we will reveal whether inceptor, beside desensitizing the insulin receptor, has also a function as insulin receptor in starvation/stress-induced insulin degradation and as scavenger receptor for insulin lysosomal degradation. This will reveal if inceptor can be targeted to enhance β-cell insulin sensitization, secretion and function.In Aim 2 we will translate our basic findings to in vivo animal and human model systems to explore GLP-1-mediated β-cell delivery and targeting of WNT and β-cell insulin/IGF1 signaling to enhance specificity and target several pathways at once. Furthermore, we will genetically and pharmacologically target inceptor and test if monoclonal antibodies alone or as drug conjugates can promote β-cell protection and regeneration.

T2D is caused by pancreatic β-cell failure and insulin resistance. Recent studies point to aberrant islet inflammation as a driver of diabetes. While inflammation is beneficial for insulin secretion during homeostasis, it may transform to harm β-cell function and impair the glucose response. How islet inflammation maintains glucose homeostasis and why it converts to being destructive remain largely open questions. Here, I introduce a novel physiological mechanism, pericyte-orchestrated islet inflammation (PIIN), which is disturbed by diabetes risk factors to cause β-cell failure. To establish its requirement for β-cell function, we will first define the role of PIIN in homeostasis. We will then determine how T2D environmental risks, such as obesity and aging, hamper pericyte cytokine production and transform islet inflammation to cause β-cell dysfunction. Lastly, we will link T2D genetic risk factors with aberrant PIIN. To this end, we will analyze human and mouse tissues and use transgenic models to manipulate cells and genes to define the effect of PIIN on β-cell function. Ultimately, our findings will provide a mechanism through which T2D risk factors induce β-cell failure and promote disease progression. The implications of this project are far-reaching, as they will introduce a novel cellular mechanism that integrates metabolic and genetic risks to cause diabetes. Furthermore, our findings will implicate PIIN as a novel target for new therapeutic approaches to diabetes.']"

Resistance to molecularly targeted therapies and chemotherapy can arise from selective growth of pre-existing sub-clones that carries drug-resistance mutations, altered metabolic and/or epigenomic states, providing a survival advantages. Early detection of these subclonal states can thus significantly aid cancer therapy. However, attempts to profile various types of primary cancer cells using single-cell techniques are relatively poor. One of the major limitations is the significant dropout rate (i.e., loss of alleles) observed in single-cell RNA-seq. It severely affects our ability to leverage single cell RNA-seq to accurately profile somatic mutation, to reveal cancer driver mutation and even extract low/mid-level expressed genes and splicing. For that reason, most of the efforts to expose mutations that are critical for cancer growth and can subsequently lead to more effective treatment are based on the sequencing of bulk populations. However, due to the noise introduced by PCR, sequencing and alignment processes, bulk sequencing is limited to identify mutations with a frequency higher than 5%. Here we propose to develop a novel 3D clone-based full-length RNA-seq profiling technology. A preliminary version of this technology for digital profiling of mRNA, already allowed us to significantly improve sensitivity comparing to gold-standard single-cell RNA-seq methods. Using this preliminary version on clones of lung adenocarcinoma, we revealed novel cancer stem like subpopulation that could not be detected using regular single cell RNA-seq maps. Altogether, improving the ability to detect rare mutations (<5%), splicing events and transcriptional variation between cancer cells, will be an extremely powerful tool for early diagnosis of cancer and effective means to improve personalized based drug treatment decision making.', 'Tracking epigenetic plasticity in circulating tumor-derived DNA to monitor drug resistance and guide personalized treatment in cancer patients\nPersonalized therapy has revolutionized cancer care during the past decades, but still suffers from frequent drug resistance and relapse. A better understanding of drug resistance mechanisms and their timely tracking and prevention represent areas of urgent clinical unmet need. While novel or clonally selected genetic lesions including DNA mutations and copy number changes are well known causes of therapy failure, emerging evidence supports a role for non-genetic/epigenetic heterogeneity and plasticity in the selective process to escape the pressure of therapy. In addition to unravelling the mechanisms controlling this epigenetic plasticity to identify new therapeutic strategies, there is a growing need for novel tools to detect and monitor epigenetic heterogeneity and plasticity that currently do not exist. EpiGuide aims to establish a blood-based monitoring tool to trace epigenetic mechanisms driving drug resistance development during treatment. I will develop and optimize the EpiGuide assay, an analytic and computational pipeline that measures and monitors methylation and histone modifications of circulating cell-free DNA that tumor cells shed into the blood plasma. In a next step, the efficacy of the EpiGuide assay to detect epigenetic tumor cell state changes will be validated in mouse models and patient samples. The EpiGuide assay will also explore temporal and spatial dynamics of epigenetic switches related to drug resistance, and look for associations with clinical outcome. The long-term goal is to bring the EpiGuide assay into clinical practice for monitoring in clinical trials and personalized cancer care. Major impact of EpiGuide is expected for guiding patient-tailored and disease state-adapted therapies, with a specific benefit of earlier detection of evolving non-genetic tumor cell states leading to drug resistance.', 'Dynamics of Adaptation and Resistance in Cancer: MApping and conTrolling Transcriptional and Epigenetic Recurrence\nTumours evolve, transforming from early-stage curable disease into treatment-refractory, deadly cancer. Therapy resistance is arguably the biggest problem in oncology today, and much of it remains unexplained. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that a large proportion of unexplained drug resistance is due to heritable epigenetic alterations, and non-heritable transcriptional plasticity in cancer cells. I refer to these mechanisms as the dark matter of cancer evolution. Genetic, epigenetic and transcriptional adaptation, together with changes in the tumour microenvironment, may happen at the same time in the same tumour. Lack of knowledge of these mechanisms hinders the development of new treatments strategies. Tackling drug resistance requires a unique combination of clinical cohorts, experimental models, evolutionary biology and computational methods.I will map and quantify the mechanisms and evolutionary dynamics of genetic and non-genetic drug resistance at unprecedented scale. I will focus on colorectal cancer, the third most common cancer and second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. I will use patient-derived organoid models, matched to clinical cohorts followed longitudinally. I will measure organoid evolution under the pressure of cancer drugs, with and without the tumour microenvironment. I will track cell lineages with lentiviral barcoding and perform longitudinal single cell multi-omics, measuring genomes, epigenomes and transcriptomes of the same cell. I will interpret the results within a unique computational framework that brings together evolutionary theory with machine learning to measure, predict and control resistance.This project will identify new mechanisms and dynamics of cancer drug resistance, deliver new predictive models, and find novel collateral drug sensitivities. This will allow designing rational drug combinations and schedules that will prevent or delay resistance, drastically improving patient outcome.']"

ESCAPE’s main objective is to improve efficiency and scalability of early pandemic response plans by providing evidence-based guidelines, standardised research protocols, retrospective insights, and digital solutions that will support scientists in producing and integrating evidence and inform public health authorities in taking decisions to avert or reduce disease and societal burden. The project will provide knowledge and tools that will enhance Europe’s preparedness for a pandemic of pathogen X. These include a science-based blueprint for faster and better decision-making in managing pandemics, tools and frameworks to improve data availability, collection and sharing, as well as advanced analytics and models to understand and project transmission dynamics of pathogen X under candidate response scenarios. ESCAPE will also identify determinants of success and failure in managing pathogen X based on the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, helping to develop effective response strategies for future pandemics. In addition, the project will contribute to fostering a multi-stakeholder intelligent community allowing improved knowledge sharing and cooperation between policy-makers, the scientific community, the media and the public, ensuring a much more effective response to future pandemics. In the long-term, by improving pandemic preparedness and the effectiveness of response to a pandemic of pathogen X, the project will contribute to reducing health burden and potential negative societal and economic consequences during pandemics, as well as increase the confidence of policy makers and the public in science-based solutions.', 'Pandemic literacy and viral zoonotic spillover risk at the frontline of disease emergence in Southeast Asia to improve pandemic preparedness\nThe PANDASIA project addresses the call by providing a framework that will increase our understanding of the biology of viruses with emerging infectious disease potential and their interaction with humans, animals and the environment and translating this understanding into proactive preventative actions. Such research is crucial for providing evidence-based knowledge and tools for better integrative public health measures for local and national actors. We will develop models to identify and predict drivers of disease emergence, which will be evaluated with real world data, refined and used to develop health and pandemic literacy intervention strategies that reduce risk of future viral emergence, thereby reducing the burden of zoonotic spillover to human health. Since pandemics arise at a local level it is important to engage with local communities and health, environment and agriculture authorities to improve their health and pandemic literacy to ensure adequate preparedness and vigilance for future spillover events and human, animal and environmental health threats. Understanding spillover dynamics and threats at local levels in emerging disease hotspot areas, such as Southeast Asia, is important for the European Union to improve preparedness and the ability to respond quickly to health emergencies and cross-border threats. The identified drivers are likely generalizable to other emerging infectious disease hotspots in the region and if successfully implemented in SE Asia could be adapted to other hotspot regions, such as in South America and Africa.', 'Infectious Disease decision-support tools and Alert systems to build climate Resilience to emerging health Threats\nClimate change is one of several drivers of recurrent outbreaks and geographical range expansion of zoonotic infectious diseases in Europe. Policy and decision-makers need tailored monitoring of climate-induced disease risk, and decision-support tools for timely early warning and impact assessment for proactive preparedness and timely responses. The abundance of open data in Europe allows the establishment of more effective, accessible, and cost-beneficial prevention and control responses. IDAlert will co-create novel policy-relevant pan-European indicators that track past, present, and future climate-induced disease risk across hazard, exposure, and vulnerability domains at the animal, human and environment interface. Indicators will be sub-national, and disaggregated through an inequality lens. We will generate tools to assess cost-benefit of climate change adaptation and mitigation measures across sectors and scales, to reveal novel policy entry points and opportunities.  Surveillance, early warning and response systems will be co-created and prototyped to increase health system resilience at regional and local levels, and explicitly reduce socio-economic inequality. Indicators and tools will be co-produced through multilevel engagement, innovative methodologies, existing and new data streams and citizen science, taking advantage of intelligence generated from selected hotspots in Spain, Greece, The Netherlands, Sweden, and Bangladesh that are experiencing rapid urban transformation and heterogeneous climate-induced disease threats. For implementation, IDAlert has assembled European authorities in climate modelling, infectious disease epidemiology, social sciences, environmental economics, One Health and EcoHealth. Further, by engaging critical stakeholders from the start, IDAlert will ensure long-lasting impacts on EU climate policy, and provide new evidence and tools for the European Green Deal to strengthen population health resilience to climate change.']"

Providing high-quality, equitable, and cost-effective care across the continuum of supportive, palliative, end-of-life, and survivorship care for both patients and their frequently overburdened family caregivers is highly relevant from an economic, a healthcare and a prevention perspective. Aims: The EU NAVIGATE project is an interdisciplinary, cross-country and intersectoral project aiming to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a Navigation Intervention (NavCare-EU) for older people with cancer and their family caregivers in different health care systems in Europe. Concept and methods: NavCare-EU is a person- and family-centered non-pharmacological intervention in which navigators collaborate with patients and families to improve quality of life and well-being, foster empowerment, and facilitate timely and equitable access to health and social care services and resources as needed, throughout the supportive and palliative care continuum. NavCare-EU is based on the existing and successfully tested Nav-Care intervention from Canada. Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness will be evaluated through an international pragmatic randomized controlled trial among 532 cancer patients aged 70 years and older and their family caregivers. Robust mixed-method subgroup analyses and in-depth process and implementation evaluations are also included. Impact: EU NAVIGATE will advance the state of the art by providing innovative solutions to the complex supportive and palliative care needs experienced by older cancer patients and their families, which is implementable in the real world and in diverse health care systems and contexts. User and stakeholder involvement methods are integrated throughout the whole project.', 'Developing and implementing innovative Patient-Centred Care Pathways for cancer patients\nIn the EU, 2.7M people were diagnosed with and 1.3M died of cancer in 2020. Over 12M people have survived cancer, thanks to advances in early detection and new therapies. With higher cure rates and more patients living longer with cancer, access to patient-centred care consisting of optimal supportive, palliative, survivorship and end-of-life care becomes increasingly important. However, cancer care still has silos, and to this day, there is no technical support available that is suitable for different cultures, settings and environments.Several randomised controlled trials have provided evidence that the integration of patient-centred care in standard oncology care results in better patient and caregiver outcomes. As yet, these findings have not translated into clinical routine.In this project, we will develop technology-enhanced and evidence-based patient-centred care pathways, called MyPath, to be merged with tumour-centred treatments across supportive, palliative, survivorship and end-of-life care. MyPath integrates patient-reported outcomes of the OUS Eir software, to be further advanced with contributions of renowned European oncologists, ethicists, psychologists and sociologists. It will be configurated on the eHealth platform of our SME partner DNV Imatis. Its effectiveness and sustainability will be assessed in an implementation science study in 9 clinical centres across Europe. With the support of leading cancer care professional associations ESMO and EAPC, and the cancer patient organisation ECPC, we are committed to delivering the right care to the right person at the right time by the right persons.We hypothesise that MyPath can significantly improve the quality of and access to treatment and care, reduce variations in clinical practice, and optimise resources in family, community, and hospital care settings. This will ultimately reduce the physical, emotional, and ultimately economic burden linked to cancer.', 'CANCER PREVENTION AMONG INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL ILL-HEALTH: CO-ADAPTING AND IMPLEMENTING PATIENT NAVIGATION FOR PRIMARY CANCER PREVENTION\nCancer and mental ill-health constitute leading public health problems in Europe, with more than 80 million people reporting mental health issues in Europe and around 4 million new cases of cancer diagnosed per year. People with mental ill-health, have higher cancer incidence and reported mortality, an excess linked to risky health behaviours as well as significant barriers experienced when accessing the often highly fragmented health care systems. Timely and evidence-based preventive strategies including optimizing health care pathways provide a solution to the high cancer morbidity and could improve overall health outcomes in this disadvantaged population. The aim of the Co-CAPTAIN project is to deliver an innovative solution based on the Patient Navigation Model. The Patient Navigation Model is an evidence-based patient-centred intervention which supports patient empowerment through removal of systemic barriers, providing social support and promoting timely access to primary prevention services. Co-CAPTAIN includes partner organizations with long-standing experience in the field of health and social care for people with mental ill-health in the south, east, northwest and central Europe, as well as academic institutions and local governments. Based on implementation science know-how and using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation as well as the Research and the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance frameworks, the Co-CAPTAIN project aims to reduce the gap in health inequalities for people with mental ill-health by reducing cancer burden and improving overall health, which will, in turn, reduce associated costs across health and social care systems in Europe. Moreover, the Co-CAPTAIN project aims to harness the transformative potential of the integrated care pathways in cancer as well as provide health and social care policy recommendations for the adoption and implementation of the Patient Navigation Model across Europe. This action is part of the Cancer Mission cluster of projects on ‘Prevention and early detection’.']"

The hematopoietic system is maintained by hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). HSCs reside in the bone marrow (BM) within specialized niches, where they self-renew and differentiate to produce all blood and immune cells. In the clinical setting of BM transplantation, HSCs from older donors result in a reduced transplantation success, with a worse level of engraftment and higher overall mortality. This demonstrates that there is a reduction in the function of aged human HSCs (hHSCs). Causes of this impaired hHSC function with age still remain unclear. Therefore, it is of great importance to uncover and subsequently target factors that contribute to hHSC aging in order to attenuate impaired haematopoiesis in the elderly. Due to the lack of meaningful human BM (hBM) niche models in the aging field, the current understanding of how extrinsic changes (stemming from the aged hBM niche) contribute to the aging of hHSC is far less advanced compared to the knowledge of the contribution of cell-intrinsic changes. Thus, this proposal focuses on providing a significant understanding of age-associated changes within the hBM niche and their contribution to the aging of hHSCs using an aging-centred hBM niche model. Transplantation of young BM hHSCs into this advanced niche model revealed that an aged hBM niche confers aging on young hHSCs. To this end, the target of the proposal is to address the following questions:(i)How does aging affect the cellular and molecular composition of the hBM niche?(ii)To which extent does an aged hBM niche affect aging of hHSCs?(iii)What are the underlying mechanisms that confer an age-like function on hHSCs?MANAGE HSC addresses both technological and conceptual challenges in studying the role of the hBM niche in regulating hHSC function in the context of normal hematopoiesis and aging.', 'Deciphering the intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms shaping aging and leukemic evolution of hematopoietic stem cells at the single cell level\nClonal Hematopoiesis (CH) is an age related state in which a single and genetically defined Hematopoietic Stem Cell (HSC) contributes more than expected to the hematopoietic pool, due to the selective advantage conferred by genetic variants termed preleukemic mutations (pLMs). CH is a significant risk factor for hematological malignancies such as Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS). Today, the mechanisms by which pLMs provide selective advantage and why in some cases clones become leukemic is not fully understood. This project focuses on understanding the dynamic changes that occur in human HSCs in aging and disease at the single cell level. Specifically, we wish to answer the following questions: 1) What are the functional consequences of aging on peripheral blood HSCs 2) what are the functional consequences of pLMs in CH, but also in AML and MDS in humans? 3) which microenvironmental factors provide selective advantage to the mutated clones? To answer these questions, we aim at developing a new innovative approach that will allow us to interrogate thousands of single HSCs from young/old/CH/AML/MDS patients to extract their genotype and their dynamic expression profiles at different time point of differentiation, under different culture conditions. This project will be performed in the Weizmann Institute, one of the world’s leading multidisciplinary basic research institutions in the natural and exact sciences. It will be highly interdisciplinary as it will involve collaboration with renown researchers from the Computer Science and the Chemistry department. In addition to the knowledge acquired in the lab and through the different collaborations, the fellow will benefit from high level training through attendance of various courses, seminars and international conferences. Overall, this project should have great benefit for the career of the fellow.', 'Mechanistic models of leukemia-niche interaction using multimodal single cell profiling\nThe bone marrow is one of the most dynamic adult stem cell niches containing hematopoietic stem cells and non-hematopoietic mesenchymal stem and stromal cells, which make up the bone marrow niche. The niche regulates the immune system and constitutes a major determinant of chemoresistance in hematological malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Identifying the mechanisms by which AML interacts with its niche will open novel therapeutic avenues.AML is driven and maintained by leukemic stem cells (LSCs), and failure to eradicate them will result in relapsing of the disease. Yet, despite decades of research on LSCs, none of the therapies aiming at eradicating them reached clinical practice. Recent studies suggest an important role for bone marrow stromal and immune cells in driving AML. Together with our preliminary data, that show LSCs-induced upregulation of metastasis-related genes in stromal cells, this leads to the hypothesis that AML remodels its niche in ways that favours its survival and represses healthy hematopoiesis. Most studies in AML focus on LSC-intrinsic, stromal niche, or immune mediated mechanisms separately. Thus, we currently lack a comprehensive view of the complexity of the human bone marrow and its interaction with AML. To close these gaps, we propose an ambitious experimental design including multi-modal single cell sequencing of an AML cohort followed by innovative computational approaches integrating these data into predictive cell-type specific models - to generate mechanistic hypotheses about AML-niche interactions that we then test using patient-derived xenograft and in vitro culture models. Our ambitious project will provide fundamental insights into stem cell-niche interactions and may lead to a paradigm-shift in treating hematological malignancies - away from eradicating malignant cells towards reconstituting a healthy niche that generates a healthy immune environment.']"

The dramatic shape changes eukaryotic cells have to undergo to divide are mostly driven by the cell surface, a complex system that can dynamically modify its mechanical properties. While the importance of physical cues for cell division has long been recognized, the lack of specific tools that modify particular physical properties and bridge molecular-to-cellular scale biophysics prevent us from understanding how cells use their mechanics to regulate form and function. To address this, my group has recently developed a new class of molecular tools that for the first time allows us to manipulate surface mechanics specifically and acutely in living cells. Exploiting this powerful new structural biophysics approach, our first discoveries excitingly demonstrate that the strength of tethering between the plasma membrane and the cortical cytoskeleton is a key control mechanism for cell division, both in cultured cells as well as in mouse embryos.The overarching goal of MitoMeChAnics is to systematically understand how cell surface mechanics controls the different steps of division. My team and I will systematically and quantitatively link cell surface architecture with the resulting mechanics and morphology to determine the structure-function relationship at the cellular periphery in space and time. To this end, we will deploy novel molecular tools and combine them with cellular biophysical measurements, super resolution microscopy and in situ cryo-electron tomography. Moreover, we will build data-driven theoretical models to unravel the physical principles that control the membrane-cortex interface, and test their predictions with novel optogenetic tools. Our project thus takes a highly interdisciplinary approach, combining mechanobiology, molecular engineering, structural analysis and theory to decipher how cells their mechanics to control mitosis.', 'Control of Host Mechanics by a Bacterial Pathogen and Functional Impact\nMammalian cells sense and exert forces on their environment, and their responses to mechanical signals regulate their growth, motility, and behavior within tissues. However, little is known about the forces at play during microbial infections, and their impact on tissue homeostasis and disease progression. I recently found that binding of the extracellular bacterium Neisseria meningitidis (Nm) on the endothelium leads to the generation of large traction forces on the extracellular matrix. This is due to the formation of a new structure, that I called ancreopodia, linking the bacterial colony on the apical side of the host cell to the basal side and underlying substrate. I hence hypothesize that Nm induces long-range force transmission throughout the infected cells, leading to alterations in tissue function.In this project, I propose to dissect how host cell mechanics is affected by Nm infection, and how mechanical forces globally impact tissue barrier physiology in epithelia and endothelia. By developing quantitative tools to directly measure forces while imaging host cells during infection, both in vitro using 2D and 3D models of tissue barrier with increasing complexity and in vivo, I will: 1) identify the key molecular mechanisms involved in host cell structural remodeling and their regulation in space and time; 2) characterize the mechanics of the infected host tissue, using biophysical tools and theoretical approaches to link signaling to the forces involved, and 3) study the functional consequences of infection-induced mechanical imbalance on cell fate and host tissue integrity. This study has a double interest: to better understand the impact of mechanics in the process of infection, for the development of new therapeutic strategies, and to bring new fundamental knowledge on the mechanical homeostasis of tissue barriers, by integrating extracellular pathogens as new tools to shed light on complex feedbacks between cell architecture, mechanics, and function', 'Morphogenesis meets Cell Fate: Dissecting how Mechanical Forces coordinate Development\nDuring embryonic development, an unspecialized cell mass is transformed into complex tissues and organs through collective movements and cell interactions. The acquisition of such structural and functional diversity is powered by two main processes: morphogenesis, which sculpts cells into tissues and organs, and cell fate acquisition, which assigns specific identities to cells. Despite extensive research, the intricate coordination between these two processes remains elusive. Mechanical forces determine the shape and structure of tissues, and their impact on cell fate has been recently uncovered, emphasizing the significance of mechanics in regulating both morphogenesis and cell fate. However, understanding the relationship between these two processes is complex, as it requires the integration of cell shape, cell behavior, mechanics, and gene expression across the tissue over time. In this project, we will apply cutting-edge biophysical and data science methods to the mucociliary epithelium of Xenopus embryos to dissect the role of mechanics in both morphogenesis and cell fate acquisition in vivo. We will first determine how cells undergoing fate acquisition trigger local tissue rearrangements that lead to global morphogenetic movements. Next, we will investigate the impact of tissue mechanics on cell fate and transitions. Finally, we will combine cell behaviors, gene expression, and mechanics into a model to predict cell fate. By exploring the ways cells respond to and modify their mechanical surroundings and the circumstances in which external forces determine cell fate, we will uncover the basic principles of complex tissue formation. This research will give us a comprehensive understanding of how individual cells, as mechanical elements, interact to form a tissue structure that is more than just the sum of its parts. The findings will have a significant impact on other tissues, particularly the human airways, and advance our knowledge of embryonic development.']"

The production and use of pharmaceuticals cause high CO2 emissions, contamination of soils, biota, and water, and even dangers to human health through carcinogenic impurities.

The European Green Deal has led to strict regulations on environmental pollution by the pharma industry, causing manufacturers to move outside of the EU due to the high costs associated with green pharma. This results in supply chain fragility and low crisis preparedness in Europe. New methods to produce pharmaceuticals in a green, efficient, and economically friendly way are required.The IMPACTIVE project brings together the expertise and knowledge from two COST Actions and will develop novel green methods to produce active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) using mechanochemistry as a disruptive technology (as acknowledged by IUPAC). Mechanochemistry uses mechanical processes, such as ball milling, twin-screw extrusion, resonant acoustic mixing, and spray drying, to induce chemical reactions. The advantages of mechanochemistry include: no solvent use, high efficiency, low costs, and reduced energy use and CO2 emission. Upon completion of the project, we will provide proof-of-concept at a small pilot scale of the use of mechanochemistry to produce 6 APIs from 3 different families of compounds. Based on a recent study, switching to mechanochemistry can reduce terrestrial ecotoxicity and CO2 emissions by more than 85%, while production costs were reduced with 12%.

There is accumulating evidence linking EDCs or their mixtures with an increased incidence of obesity, atherosclerosis, and type 2 diabetes. Developmental exposure to EDCs can exert life-long, even transgenerational effects and affects the susceptibility to many diseases. However, the metabolic effects of EDCs are still poorly understood and the lack of mechanistic data and predictive models of adverse metabolic outcomes of EDCs hinders their risk assessment. The “Novel Effect biomarkers for MEtabolic disruptorS: evidence on health Impacts to science and policy needS” (NEMESIS) consortium brings together experts in toxicology, medicine, risk assessment, and social sciences and humanities to respond to the unmet regulatory needs of EDCs within silico, in vitro, in vivo, epidemiological and systems biology data on EDC-mediated metabolic effects in multifactorial models. We will assess mechanistic data on metabolic disruption in liver and pancreas and how EDCs or their mixtures affect the microbiota, enhanced with data on dose-response relationships and the causality of these actions. In addition, NEMESIS will provide human exposure data of EDCs and explore effect biomarkers for metabolic disruption. NEMESIS’ results will improve assessment of metabolic endpoints in testing guidelines and adopt alternative models to animal testing.

The new European Growth Strategy aims at sustainable growth, zero-pollution and safe chemicals. While the need for increased chemical testing is tangible, there is a movement to phase out animal experiments. This creates a huge challenge to deliver on the vision of a safe and toxic-free environment. Here, I will develop new high-content assays for reproductive toxicity in women. SAFER is built on my exceptional ovary biobank, established stem cell lines, and multi-omics technologies. Using chemically exposed ovarian tissue and stem cell derived blastoid cultures, SAFER will map mechanisms mediating toxicity by high-resolution epigenetic and transcriptomic analyses. Model chemicals are chosen based on ubiquitous presence in women and significant associations to decreased ovarian function, as shown by my cohort studies. The identified mechanisms will be tailored into reporter genes that I will insert into new immortalized human ovarian cells as well as stem cells, and develop into high-content screening assays. The product of SAFER is novel in vitro tools for screening of female reproductive toxicants.Taken together, SAFER sets an example for animal-free derivation of assays for chemical safety assessment. SAFER tools will contribute to identification and restriction of chemicals that pose a hazard to women’s health.

The EU has highlighted EDCs as substances of high concern and aims to minimise exposure of humans and the environment by improving regulation and policy. Yet there remain important gaps in our understanding of the impact of exposures at critical life stages and the tools for identification and ultimately regulation of EDCs. The MERLON project addresses these gaps, bringing together world-leading experts in endocrinology, chemical safety assessment, developmental and molecular biology, epidemiology, toxicogenomics, toxicokinetics modelling, regulatory toxicology, psychology, psychiatry and research ethics. We will investigate EDC-mediated effects on sexual development, providing human data on the role of EDC exposure during fetal development and changes in mini-puberty, connecting to puberty, reproductive function, and gender incongruence using existing biobanks and cohorts. MERLON will apply and develop 3R-compliant New Approach Methodologies (NAMs) focusing on sexual development and function and the effects of EDCs thereon. Our cutting-edge approaches incorporate transcriptomics, pharmacokinetic models, biomarker identification and the use of Adverse Outcome Pathways, which we will utilize to develop a roadmap for EDC identification, making the best use of NAMs into the future. With MERLON, we will engage EU risk assessment bodies, public health authorities, regulators, scientists and researchers, healthcare providers and citizens.

Because of their assumed pro-tumourigenic functions, CAFs have long been considered an attractive therapeutic target. However, recent evidence indicates that multiple CAF subpopulations showing inflammatory, myofibroblastic, vascular, antigen-presenting, and immunosuppressive phenotypes co-exist within the same tumour, – with some promoting and other restricting tumour growth; thus, making their targeting challenging. How CAFs change dynamically as cancers evolve, and how this may affect the overall tumour heterogeneity, remains unaddressed. Therefore, the main goal of DynamHet is to elucidate the origin and evolution of CAF heterogeneity and to decipher the mediators and mechanisms that regulate CAF plasticity as the tumour advances. This is crucial for the development of effective therapies aimed at reprogramming CAFs towards therapeutically favourable phenotypes and will constitute a great breakthrough in the field of oncology. Hence, DynamHet aims to 1) decipher the origin of CAF heterogeneity by performing clonal tracing and by generating and characterising CAF subtypes starting from human induced pluripotent stem cells; 2) dissect CAF-TME crosstalk by generating 3D patient-derived organoids and spheroids and by analysing their secretome and transcriptomic profiles using high throughput technologies and computational analysis; and 3) reprogramme CAFs by genetic manipulation in favour of therapeutically advantageous subpopulations as a novel therapeutic approach. DynamHet is an ambitious and feasible project that stands as a pioneer in the new concept of deciphering the origin and reprogramming the dynamic heterogeneity of CAFs towards the development of innovative precision medicine approaches in cancer.', 'Harnessing Stromal Fibroblasts to Reduce Resistance and Improve Colon Cancer Therapeutics\nRefractory tumors and emergence of drug resistance are the most important challenges in cancer therapeutics. The non-cancerous determinants of therapeutic response and particularly the role of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in resistance are poorly understood. I previously described the crucial role of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in key tumorigenic processes, including matrix remodeling, cancer cell invasion and growth. Importantly, these aggressive CAF phenotypes are controlled by mechanical reprogramming and mechanotransduction pathways. Within therapeutic resistance contexts, I hypothesize that preexistent and therapy-induced aberrant activation of mechanotransduction signaling in CAFs leads to the generation of refractory TMEs affecting cancer cell signaling and the behavior of accessory stromal cells such as endothelial and immune cells. As a result, tumors will present: (i) abnormal vasculature associated with reduced drug perfusion and chemotherapy efficacy; (ii) increased production of pro-survival signals affecting targeted therapy; and (iii) inactivation of cytolytic T cells and reduced responses to immunotherapy. I propose that CAF-based biomarkers will improve our capacity to identify patients most likely to respond to these therapeutics. In addition, targeting mechanotransduction in CAFs will significantly increase efficacy in non-responders. Focusing in colorectal cancer, I will use patient-derived CAFs as a tractable system and organ-on-chip, in vitro and preclinical models of CAF-mediated resistance, and combinatorial chemistry to systematically elucidate the molecular and biological features conferring CAFs their privileged therapy-resistance properties. This will illuminate novel and general mechanisms whereby TME characteristics influence tumorigenesis, and inform the development of refined biomarkers to stratify patients and next generation combinatorial therapies (including anti-CAF therapies) with reduced risk of recurrence.', ""HIF-1α in Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts: Unveiling implications for the tumor microenvironment and therapeutic strategies\nColorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Despite significant advancements in understanding CRC pathogenesis, the clinical prognosis of CRC patients is still poor due to metastasis dissemination. Cancer progression is often associated with the presence of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the tumor microenvironment that regulate processes such as extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and repression of the immune response. The establishment of a hypoxic environment and activation of its main effector, the hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), are common features of advanced cancers.  HIF-1α is a transcription factor, which regulates several genes that are exploited by tumor cells to escape from a nutrient-deprived environment and to survive as well as resist to treatment. However, the role of HIF-1α in CAFs has not be addressed so far in CRC. This research seeks to elucidate the effects of hypoxia on different aspects of CAFs' function , using in vitro functional assays and innovative co-culture models with patient-derived CAFs and matching tumor organoids. Furthermore, the study aims to unveil the role of HIF-1α expression in CAFs during tumor initiation and progression using a colitis-associated carcinogenesis model and pinpoint the origin of HIF-1α+ CAFs employing a lineage tracing model. Finally, in silico analysis of scRNAseq data will allow to detect the subset of CAFs that are responsive to hypoxia in different stages of carcinogenesis and in metastatic dissemination. Overall, this project will study the unappreciated role of HIF-1α in CAFs in the context of CRC with the ultimate goal to pave the way to new therapeutic strategies.""]"

The REACT consortium ? uniting high-level experts in virology, immunology, clinical medicine, epidemiology, and bioinformatics ? will assess genotypic, high-dimensional immunophenotypic, demographic and clinical data in the context of disease course to define host-pathogen interactions of viral respiratory tract infections, focusing on the predominating viruses i.e. influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In characterised, ethnically diverse clinical cohorts comprising patients with varying disease severities, we will genotype both virus and host, map deep immunological phenotypes spanning cellular, humoral and innate immunity, and characterise host responses in human nasal epithelial organoid models following viral infection. Novel bioinformatics approaches that include knowledge discovery and machine learning will be used to integrate and analyse multidisciplinary datasets to assess the individual and combined impact of factors on disease phenotype. Information on the deep characterisation of the dynamics of the immune responses to the chosen viruses and identified factors critical for viral control and immune protection will be made available on a dedicated project website to clinicians, researchers, health authorities, and public.

The molecular and physiological mechanisms of how these viral infections cause and contribute to non-communicable disease development are unknown. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a virus that infects nearly all infants before the age of 2 years and that is linked to asthma development. We propose an integrative approach to identify genetic risk factors and mechanisms underlying virus-induced asthma. Specifically, using two national cohorts (Estonian and Spanish), we will identify human genetic risk factors and RSV strains that contribute to severe bronchiolitis. We analyse how RSV perturbs intracellular networks to change cellular properties that trigger asthma development. We will use Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based techniques to integrate generated data with the current biological knowledge, to generate RSV-induced perturbation signatures and to identify drug-like compounds able to revert the effects of the RSV-induced perturbations. We will validate both mechanisms and candidate compounds in patient derived airway organoid models and, when promising, in a controlled human infection model trial. CLARITY will impact the understanding, prevention and possibly treatment of virus-triggered asthma. The results will enable development of a genetic risk score for long-term asthma development that enables personalised prevention campaigns, which will be developed jointly with patient groups. The molecular mechanisms discovered, and the drug-like compounds that revert the perturbation signatures, will enable development of mechanism-targeted drugs.

The vast majority of in vitro studies has been performed with model cancer cell lines. However, they share limited features with the primary cells found within the human respiratory epithelium. Robust and relevant, ex vivo models of human primary airway epithelia, cultured at the air-liquid interface (ALI) have been developed over the years and nicely recapitulate the structure and composition of the in vivo respiratory epithelium. Nevertheless, in depth studies on the genes and the potent innate immune, interferon (IFN)-induced, defences regulating viral replication in such pertinent models are still lacking. The InVIRium project will address this knowledge gap by combining a newly acquired expertise in the generation and gene editing of human ALI airway epithelia, with a strong expertise in CRISPR screens and virology. The objectives of InVIRium will be to explore in depth the relationships between major human respiratory viruses, SARS-CoV-2, IAV, IBV and RSV, and their relevant, primary target cells. InVIRium will characterize the IFN-stimulated-genes responsible for the potent antiviral state, explore the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 escape from the IFN system and define the landscape of host genes regulating respiratory virus infection in this physiologically relevant ALI model. InVIRium will bring a change of paradigm in the way we study respiratory viruses, by implementing cutting-edge approaches in highly pertinent human models and will gather fundamental knowledge that is currently lacking on the interactions between viruses and their primary target cells.']"

Late AMD is the leading cause of legal blindness >50 years with 110 mio individuals at risk. The multidisciplinary consortium brings together a network of clinical retina experts, computer scientists working at the cutting edge of AI development, an infrastructure of community-based opticians/optometrists and an SME experienced in digital platform performance to develop innovative and trustworthy AI tools for broad, real-time AMD screening and monitoring via a cloud-based infrastructure with unlimited access. To achieve the ambitious goal of finding “the needle in the haystack” in early AMD, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), a high-resolution, effortless imaging modality is used providing a detailed characterization of the retina in extensive volumetric scans. Breakthrough AI approaches for medical imaging will be developed to enable data-efficient and robust learning from sparse longitudinal OCT data to systematically analyse dense data volumes and identify (sub)clinical markers of disease activity. Clinical sites throughout Europe will collect a longitudinal cohort serving for calibrating and fine-tuning algorithms using the high-end OCT device available at eye clinics.

Most ocular diseases are still without drug treatment and the current treatments are based on the use of small molecules and protein drugs. However, poor ocular absorption and rapid elimination restrict their development and use in ophthalmology.Technology for mRNA transfer into the cornea and retina and subsequent expression of encoded proteins may open widely applicable possibilities for the treatment of ocular diseases (e.g. various retinal degenerations, uveitis) as topical eye drops or intravitreal injections. However, clinical application of mRNAs is limited by their poor in vivo stability and low cellular entry. Therefore, efficient and safe delivery systems for ocular mRNA transfer are urgently needed.Our research program aims to develop lipid-based nanoparticle (LNP) systems that are specifically tailored for mRNA delivery into the corneal, conjunctival and retinal cells. The project will address the critical anatomical and physiological barriers of ocular mRNA delivery topically and intravitreally. Chemical structure and composition of LNPs will be carefully modified to optimize mRNA delivery across ocular barriers. Smart pH-sensitive LNPs with eye specific surface moieties will be used to target ocular cells and trigger mRNA release and cytosolic delivery. Moreover, eye drop formulations will be mucoadhesive, increasing precorneal residence time, whereas intravitreal injectables will be capable of permeating in the vitreous and inner limiting membrane into the retinal cells. The representative in vitro and ex vivo test models will be used to select the most promising LNPs for versatile animal experiments.

While macrostructural biomarkers related to ocular shape are well-established, microstructural biomarkers related to tissue remain largely unexplored. The project's foundation rests on the preliminary work of the PI, which demonstrated the feasibility of deriving disease-related microstructure biomarkers from low-resolution clinical eye images. The approach combines data science, advanced image processing, and rigorous experimental validation to better understand the interplay between macro- and microstructural biomarkers in prevalent sight-threatening eye diseases, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), glaucoma, cataracts, and corneal ectasia, using efficient, cost-effective, and accessible tools. VISIONSAFE covers several ground-breaking aspects: clinical eye data is already available but underused (can we use data science for vision preservation?); the acquisition and combination of macro- and microstructural biomarkers from clinical images have not yet been considered (is this combination a key for the early diagnosis of eye diseases? Are we missing out essential information from already available data?). The project's potential gains are significant. It enhances knowledge on eye disease biomarkers accessible through routine eye exams, shifts the paradigm toward macro- and microstructural biomarker synergy, and represents an important step towards a future where eye diseases are identified and managed earlier, offering hope and improved quality of life to countless individuals.""]"

Recent predictions indicate that more than 1 billion people will be obese by 2030 worldwide. Contrary to white adipose tissue, brown adipose tissue (BAT) dissipates energy as heat and has been considered an important target for treating obesity and cardiometabolic diseases. Nevertheless, little is known about the interaction between diet, of the most important modifiable risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases, with BAT function. To develop new weight-loss strategies, it is essential to understand how food intake modulates BAT function by interacting with endocrine factors and how this interaction affects diet-induced thermogenesis in lean individuals and those with obesity.Recent data indicate that DIT is associated with BAT function and that gut hormones play an important part in the activation of BAT during the postprandial phase. Yet, the mechanism remains to be elucidated. Moreover, it is unclear whether DIT and cold-induced thermogenesis (CIT) share similar metabolic pathways and how the manipulation of food intake can affect BAT and, thus, energy expenditure.The main aims of FoodBAT are to investigate how the acute intake of a mixed meal modulates gut hormones to stimulate diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT) and BAT oxidative metabolism and to understand how this interplay differs between lean and obese individuals. Also, we will investigate how a cold acclimation protocol affects this interaction to modulate DIT in individuals with obesity. Finally, FoodBAT will unravel the connections and differences between DIT and CIT by comparing the gene expression and mitochondrial respiration of brown adipocytes stimulated with either nutrient overload, isoproterenol, or a combination of both. These findings will be pivotal for the development of new pharmacological and non-pharmacological (lifestyle-related) strategies to combat obesity.', 'Harnessing an energy-expending, appetite-suppressing fat-brain axis to unlock novel pharmacotherapies\nObesity and cardiometabolic diseases are global crises that threaten to cripple healthcare infrastructures. These disorders originate from an excess calorie burden caused by consuming too much food and expending too little energy. Yet despite recent advances in obesity drugs, weight-lowering pharmacotherapies only reach about half the efficacy of surgical interventions. This difference could be due to existing drugs only acting to reduce food intake and not boost calorie-burning. Therefore, I believe our discovery of a leptin-independent signaling axis between adipose tissue (AT) and the central nervous system (CNS) that both decreases food intake and increases energy expenditure poses a breakthrough in obesity research. We uncovered this axis through receptor profiling and human genetic association studies and engineered a highly selective agonist that significantly decreases bodyweight and improves glucose and lipid homeostasis in obese mice. Our preliminary data have already led to a spinout company. However, the physiological signaling mechanisms of this receptor in AT and the CNS that shape systemic energy balance through peripheral calorie-burning and central control of food intake remain unknown. Thus, in HEAT-UP, we will delineate AT and CNS receptor circuits with single cell resolution and functionally test this signaling in 3D cultures of mouse and human AT. Tissue-specific contributions to whole-body metabolism will be assessed by combining our proprietary, selective agonist with state-of-the-art viral, genetic, and surgical manipulation of the receptor and neuronal wiring in AT and the CNS. Viral and genetic cell-labeling strategies will be used to characterize novel secretory cells that we found in mouse and human AT to contain the ligand for this receptor. Collectively, these studies will provide a comprehensive, physiological overview of a previously unknown fat-brain signaling axis and insight into its potential for counteracting metabolic diseases.', 'Control of body weight by specialized brain-adipose loop neurons\nDisruption of energy homeostasis can lead to obesity, a major health issue worldwide. Therapeutic efforts to reduce adiposity are nullified by metabolic adaptations. The mechanisms underlying these phenomena are unclear, precluding efficient intervention. Although it is well established that important hormonal factors control adiposity, it is less appreciated that fat (white adipose tissue, WAT) is innervated by sympathetic and sensory fibres forming, with discrete brain nuclei, loop circuits. These circuits are well-positioned for enabling WAT-brain bidirectional, non-hormonal communication, yet they remained uncharacterized. This project will uncover the brain circuits processing sensory-sympathetic homeostatic control of body weight. Using labelling tracing strategies of the WAT, I will identify the brain areas containing loop neurons. I will interrogate their role in regulating body weight and processing WAT-derived inputs, using cutting-edge and complementary single-cell imaging and transcriptomic analysis. Complementarily, I will functionally manipulate, using opto- and chemo-genetics tools, the activity of loop neurons, and their brain→WAT outputs, in lean mice, mimicking activity changes in obesity, and assess system-wide effects on behavior, metabolism, and body weight. My expertise in both central and peripheral systems gives me a unique perspective to address these fundamental questions. Uncovering the role of non-hormonal WAT-body communication in the regulation of energy homeostasis will revolutionise our understanding of weight regulation in health and disease. This project will identify new molecular targets to develop better therapeutic strategies for obesity while also creating a platform for synergy between brain circuits and body organs, facilitating a host of future advances and new research directions.']"

Myofibroblasts are the key ECM producing cells and are activated by cross-talk with injured proximal tubule and immune cells. Although a derangement in fatty acid oxidation (FAO) of tubular epithelium is crucial in the pathophysiology of CKD, the metabolic rewiring of kidney myofibroblasts remains elusive. Our preliminary observations suggest that cell type-specific metabolic shifts could define new cellular subpopulations with a differential role in the fibrogenic response. To understand this, the following objectives have been defined: 1. To decipher the role of FAO in myofibroblasts during kidney fibrosis; 2.To dissect metabolic changes as important drivers of kidney fibrosis and CKD; 3.

Over time, CKD can progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD); a condition that can only be treated through hemodialysis or kidney transplantation, posing a severe medical, societal and economic challenge. Fibrosis is recognized as a key pathological mechanism in CKD, responsible for slowly destroying the tissue architecture of the kidney. Current therapies for CKD alleviate symptoms of the disease by controlling hypertension and hyperglycemia, but, while fibrosis is as a promising therapeutic target, no antifibrotic therapy for the kidney have reached the clinic. Hence, there is an urgent need for disease-modifying and curative treatments that can halt fibrosis.

Our preliminary data has confirmed a unique expression profile of our therapeutic target and reduced fibrosis onset in in vivo knockout models without side-effects after kidney injury.  Hence, Fibrolisine is expected to target the process of fibrogenesis and halt the progression to ESRD in early-stage CKD patients. Through the activities in FibroTarg project, we aim to demonstrate the antifibrotic potential of Fibrolisine in advanced human kidney fibrosis organoid models and in vivo models of kidney injury.

Progressive CKD not only causes kidney failure, but also premature aging, cardiovascular disease, and loss of quality of life. Currently, progressive CKD can only be diagnosed after irreversible damage to the kidney has already occurred. There is therefore an urgent need for earlier biomarkers. The kidney consists of filters and tubules, but diagnosis of progressive CKD is currently based on filter function alone. This is surprising, as it is tubular injury that drives CKD progression, and it is the tubule that is targeted by recently developed kidney-protective treatments. U-Tube therefore aims to identify and apply next-generation biomarkers for kidney tubular function to facilitate the early detection and treatment of progressive CKD. My central hypothesis is that the factors that cause tubular injury and CKD progression, are present in urine and therefore detectable as biomarkers. I will focus on urinary microcrystals and extracellular vesicles (EVs) as the drivers of tubular injury, which I will first study in tubuloids using a multi-omics approach. Subsequently, I will perform a large-scale analysis of crystallization and EVs in urine samples from people with stable or progressive CKD. I will then single out those biomarkers that can be targeted by kidney-protective treatment. These targetable biomarkers will be moved forward for the development of a high-throughput tubular panel that I will test for its potential to predict progressive CKD, compared to a gold standard test for tubular function. U-Tube will use cutting-edge innovations to identify urinary biomarkers for tubular function that are targetable and implementable in clinical practice. If successful, it will advance the prediction of CKD progression, and as such redefine how we assess kidney health. By enabling early kidney-protective treatment, U-Tube has the potential to vastly improve CKD outcomes.']"

Single therapy is not efficient to tackle metastatic melanoma and a combination of therapies is thus emerging as a necessity to efficiently eradicate all cancer cells. Recently, immunotherapy, in particular immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), has become a powerful treatment strategy for cancer. Nevertheless, the physical barriers represented by cellular and non-cellular components of the tumour microenvironment combined with immune escape mechanisms of cancer, hamper an efficient tumour infiltration and patients’ responsiveness to ICI therapy. In this context, MultiTheranostic aims to develop theranostic nanoparticles for gene therapy-mediated immune checkpoint silencing and chemotherapy, exploiting the properties of magnetic nanoparticles to induce damage locally on the tumour microenvironment by magnetic hyperthermia (MH).

Complex genetic diseases include cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and cancer, the two leading causes of death in the EU and up to 36 million Europeans suffer from rare genetic diseases. Nucleic acid therapeutics (NATs) represent a potential treatment, but they are hampered by the “delivery problem.” Systemically administered naked RNA is quickly degraded by endonucleases, can provoke adverse immune reactions and has off-target toxicity. Viral and lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery vectors have toxic side-effects and are difficult to produce and target.-The SolutionTraffikGene´s RNA delivery platform is:Safe: biodegradable, non-immunogenic peptide carriers that cleave to avoid the detergent toxicity of LNPs.Targetable: beyond the liver, to the spleen, lungs and heart with excellent delivery to the cytosol.Scalable: Production is automated, simple and cheap.TraffikGene combines modular design with high-throughput screening which will feed into AI-enhanced SAR-based predictive vehicle design. This will accelerate and de-risk NAT drug development.-The ProjectTraffikGene will capitalize on the current breakthroughs in healthcare represented by NATs.

In particular, the possibility to combinetherapeutic and imaging functionalities in a single nanoplatform (theranostic) has been widely explored to advance therapeuticapproaches and promote the transition from conventional medicine to personalized medicine.Drug nanocarriers, holding the potential to produce a revolution in medicine, are lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for gene delivery. Theyhave proven versatility and efficacy even though today it is still not possible to predict and control their cellular uptake and targeteddelivery. One of the main unmet challenges of LNP formulations is increasing their cellular uptake and gene release into the cytosol.Currently, it is possible to follow the fate of LNPs after administration only with the addition of labels (e.g., fluorophore) or specificribonucleic acid (RNA) sequence encoding for fluorescent protein. This results in the lack of possibility to follow the fate of LNPs onceadministered in vivo with a non-invasive imaging technique. Theranostic strategies to deliver RNA and simultaneous imaging oftarget organs is an important unmet goal.Recently, it has been demonstrated that fluorination of components in gene delivery vehicles strongly improved their cellular uptakeand, most importantly, their gene endosomal escape. The fluorination strategies investigated so far use either -CF3 groups or longlinear perfluoroalkyl chains, but a tailored design of the fluorinated group could also endow the nanocarrier with excellent imagingfunctions. In this context, FluoNeeD strategy is to tailor fluorination of LNPs in order to: (i) improve their therapeutic efficacy byenhancing LNP cellular uptake and promoting gene endosomal escape; (ii) render LNPs trackable in vivo by 19F-MRI and in vitro/ex vivo by Raman microscopy.', 'Targeted delivery of lipid nanoparticle-mRNA formulations modified with ligand pattern to dendritic cells based on DNA origami\nmRNA vaccines have gained considerable attentions in prevention and treatment of virus infections, cancer and genetic diseases, especially in the application to the COVID-19 pandemic in recent years. Due to the immunogenicity and instability of mRNA, the in vivo delivery of mRNA plays a crucial role in vaccine efficacy. Among various materials, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have shown to be one of the most potent carriers for mRNA delivery and successfully enter the clinic. To further improve vaccine efficacy, dendritic cells (DC) uptake can be optimized by decorating mannose ligands on LNP-mRNA formulations for targeted vaccine delivery. However, the effect of ligand density, spatial distance and organization pattern on cellular uptake remains poorly understood. Due to the addressability of DNA origami, nanoparticles and small molecules can be spatially organized into prescribed pattern with nanoscale precision. Therefore, we propose to develop designed ligand patten on LNP-mRNA formulations by transferring ligand pattern distributed on DNA origami to LNPs. With ligands modified on surface, LNP-mRNA formulations will be used to investigate the effect of ligand pattern on DC uptake, which is not accessible to other targeted delivery system. The results of the project will promote the development of vaccine delivery field. In addition, it will influence the health care and biomaterial industries, which are central to Europe’s ongoing and future economic success.']"

The average life expectancy of GBM patients is 12-18 months, and the 5-year survival rates remain below 7%. Despite the efforts, the available therapy today counts only with a few (ineffective) approved therapies.Using a machine learning algorithm, we have discovered a correlation between a small molecule and an unexplored target in GBM. We have developed a hydrogel-based formulation of the molecule with great safety and efficacy in vivo. Our formulation showed 40% long-term survival in a GBM rat model, with complete tumour eradication after a single dose treatment. NANO-PL is a one-time treatment, applied locally during surgery, which is effective even in GBM cells that are resistant to the standard of care or those involved in recurrence. NANO-PL also showed a synergistic efficacy with temozolomide, standard-of-care. The EIC will enable the clinical validation of NANO-PL, completely unlocking the GBM treatment.', 'Identification of novel targets to improve glioblastoma therapy\nGlioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant primary brain tumour in adults. The current standard of care is surgical resection of GBM tumours followed by chemotherapy and ionizing radiation (IR). Despite these intense efforts, GBM tumours remain incurable and the median survival rate of GBM patients remains only ~15 months. This dismal clinical outcome underscores the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies for GBM. At the cellular level, GBM tumours contain a rare population of self-renewing, highly invasive stem cells termed brain tumour stem cells (BTSCs). BTSCs are endowed with properties to proliferate, spur the growth of new tumours, and at the same time, evade IR and chemotherapy. Thus eradicating BTSCs in tumour bulk represents a promising approach to fight brain cancer at its roots. However, there are presently no treatments targeting BTSCs in GBM. Recent preliminary data obtained by the applicant led to the hypothesis that a novel signalling pathway, controls BTSC behaviour and represents a promising target to eradicate BTSCs. Thus, the applicant will join the Bordeaux institute of oncology (BRIC) at University of Bordeaux to test this hypothesis, under the supervision of Pr. Bikfalvi. The host, the supervisor and the candidate represents the perfect match to realise this proposal. The project is designed to bring forth a two-way transfer of knowledge between the host and the candidate. The advanced techniques and transferable skills that the candidate acquires through this research will largely broaden his competencies and increase his employability as an independent researcher in the field of neuro-oncology. Results generated through this proposal will be innovative and of clinical relevance for GBM patients.

Patients with GBM are treated with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, surgery, and tumor treating fields. Despite initial response all tumors recur as incurable lesions; there is an urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches for this patient group. The majority of GBMs recur within the treatment field receiving high-dose radiotherapy during treatment of the primary tumor; the recurrent tumor thus forms in an irradiated microenvironment. Despite the fact that it is the recurrent tumor that ultimately kills the patient and that the majority of new therapeutic agents for GBM are tested clinically in the recurrent setting, the majority of experimental models and clinical materials for drug discovery are based on primary disease. Recent advances established a central role for the tumor microenvironment in determining the therapeutic response of GBM cells, and our lab demonstrated that standard of care radiotherapy of the primary tumor can shape the microenvironment to generate tumor-supportive conditions in the recurrent tumor; These findings suggest that there is untapped potential in targeting the irradiated microenvironment. This proposal aims to explore and exploit the recurrent brain tumor microenvironment by i) consolidating the contribution of the irradiated brain tumor microenvironment to GBM resistance by integrating spatial transcriptomics, single cell RNA sequencing, and multiplexed immunohistochemistry from state-of-the-art murine and human models of GBM treatment and recurrence, and ii) discovering and targeting novel therapeutic targets unique to the post-radiotherapy brain tumor microenvironment by high-throughput phenotypic screening, with the ultimate goal of exploiting reversible stromal radiation responses and leverage novel therapeutic opportunities unique to the irradiated brain.']"

Present In Vitro Diagnostic technologies often strike a compromise between accuracy, speed, portability, and cost-effectiveness. Immunoassays offer rapidity but sacrifice accuracy, while molecular diagnostics like PCR deliver accuracy at the expense of time and ease of use. Isothermal molecular tests, on the other hand, are swift but lack specificity. Hence, a pressing need persists for point-of-care diagnostic tools that embody user-friendliness, cost-efficiency, high accuracy, and adaptability to diverse applications. At Scope Biosciences, a spin-off from Wageningen University, we have developed and patented a CRISPR-Cas diagnostic technology (scopeDx) that harnesses the precision of PCR and the speed of isothermal amplification, delivering rapid results within approximately 30 minutes at the point of care. Futhermore, the scopeDx platform can be rapidly adapted to new applications.Our objective is to complete the pre-clinical validation of our solution to offer user-friendliness, robustness, portability, and cost-effectiveness, providing swift results directly at the point-of-care.

More specifically, we will optimise an innovative, easy-to-use, scalable XBA sampling device, and compare it to a face mask sampling device coupled with rapid molecular detection in three clinical studies. We will evaluate the XBA sampling efficiency of these devices using the Respiratory Aerosol Sampling Chamber as a benchmark. Next, we will assess performance of the devices for diagnosis of TB and drug-resistance among symptomatic patients in a high burden EU country. In parallel, we will assess the feasibility of multiplexing XBA samples for multiple respiratory pathogens (i.e., TB, influenza, SARS-CoV-2) in a screening use case.

Understanding the long-term effects of domestication and breeding practices on the epidemiology and evolution of animal pathogens is yet of foremost importance given current concerns regarding modern farming practices and their impact on animal and public health. Recent major advances in sequencing and biomolecular techniques have allowed the recovery of rare and degraded DNA molecules from ancient biological samples, including those of pathogens which can persist in the remains of their hosts for millennia. Here, we will leverage a massive collection of ancient equine DNA (aDNA) libraries spanning more than 50,000 years to investigate the past epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of DNA viruses in horses and donkeys from the earliest stages of domestication to modern days. An innovative approach will be implemented for the systematic enrichment of viral DNA in aDNA libraries prior to sequencing, to maximize viral detection sensitivity. Metagenomic analyses of resulting datasets will allow characterizing ancient equine viromes and their variations through time. Ancient viral sequences will be used for genomic and phylodynamic analyses to reconstruct past viral genomic changes, geographical spread and transmission dynamics. Inferred patterns will be interpreted in the light of detailed knowledge about horse and donkey's domestication and management history which has been generated in recent years.

With these tools at hand, PROTOPEST will utilise a timely opportunity for investigating the impact of infectious disease epidemics on prehistoric human societies. The project will be centred on the 2nd millennium BCE, a period of large-scale socio-cultural transformations witnessed differentially across the archaeological records of Europe, Near East and Asia. Until now, studies have focused on environmental changes, economic shifts, warfare and human migration to explain these phenomena. Crucially, the 2nd millennium bears the earliest textual evidence of infectious disease epidemics ever identified, yet, their possible contribution to observed transformations, as well as their trans-regional impact beyond textual descriptions, remain largely unexplored. PROTOPEST will produce extensive ancient metagenomic, pathogen genomic and human genomic datasets, generated from human and animal remains across key regions of Europe, the Near East and Central Asia. Co-analysed alongside cultural, isotopic, paleodemographic and palaeopathological information, these data will be used to expose the unknown landscape of Middle/Late Bronze Age epidemics across a large geographical expanse. Our unique multidisciplinary framework will define indicators of prehistoric community responses to infectious disease outbreaks, and reveal how pathogens emerged and disseminated within and across human populations. In this capacity, PROTOPEST will provide a deep evolutionary and cultural framework for empirically examining the diachronic challenges that pathogens have posed on human societies, to gain a more holistic view on human prehistory.', 'Identifying Constraints: Ancient protein characterisation to Reveal past Human Subsistence adaptations to climate change\nFacing the constraints imposed due to climate change is a challenge past human societies had to take into consideration, similar to how current societies are facing global changes in resource availability and climate change. By looking into the past and how ancient societies adapted to temperature increase and water availability decrease could help us to innovatively deal with the current climate crisis. In the Levant, where cattle, pigs, sheep and goat have been domesticated, ecological constraints are one of the major reasons for observed changes in subsistence strategies. Traditionally, comparative anatomy of fauna remains is the methodology of choice when aiming to reconstruct past subsistence strategies. But in arid environments, archaeological bones and teeth degrades rapidly, leading to highly fragmented and poorly preserved remains, thus largely restricting faunal spectra reconstruction. This project offers a glimpse at past Levantine societies adaptation to climatic pressures by using the new and exciting field of palaeoproteomics. The fellowship will concentrate on three defined scientific objectives: 1. enhance the available protein reference sequences, crucially lacking Near-Eastern wild ungulates species; 2. identify subsistence strategy shifts along four Jordanian archaeological sites, each containing well-established stratigraphies, using ancient proteins based species identification; and 3. recover information regarding sex-driven husbandry practices in caprine herds using the new method of enamel proteome sexing. The combination of archaeology and biological sciences within the frame of ICARHUS will give the opportunity to get a glimpse into past human societies agro-cultural behaviour using methodological developments of use beyond the field of bio-archaeological sciences.']"

The parasite is reliant upon Anopheline mosquitoes for transmission and insecticide treated bed nets targeting these mosquitoes represent the single most efficacious way to reduce case numbers and hence deaths. However, due to the use of pyrethroid insecticides on all distributed insecticide treated bed nets, insecticide resistance now threatens the impact of these interventions. Analogously, deaths from active malaria cases have been decreasing through the successful use of drug therapy; however, resistance to every class of front-line drug has now been described. Incredibly, we simply do not know the impact of current vector control tools on parasite development nor the impact of drug resistance on development within the mosquito vector, despite fine scale characterisation in the erythrocytic stages. With the stalling of progress in malaria elimination and the addition of new chemistries to insecticide treated bed nets, it is time that we invested in understanding precisely how our current vector control tools affect the parasite in order to avoid catastrophic failure of malaria control. To this end, I propose to: (i) Determine the impact of insecticide use on parasite development in the contexts of species replacement, insecticide resistance and insecticide exposure; (ii) Elucidate the changes due to parasite drug resistance on mosquito-stage development; (iii) Ascertain genetic interplay between mosquito immunity and response to insecticides to identify new targets that negatively affect insecticide resistance and parasite development.

However, if this ambition is to be realised, new and innovative approaches are urgently required to accelerate next-generation vaccine research and development, whilst the few known candidate antigens need to undergo early-phase clinical assessment.Here, we build on exciting breakthroughs in P. vivax vaccine research, recently pioneered in Europe, including new transgenic parasite technologies for functional assay development and production of a parasite clone that is safe for use in controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) clinical models. The Objectives of OptiViVax will now integrate ambitious multi-disciplinary scientific and clinical approaches around the parasite’s lifecycle and will use our increased knowledge of P. vivax immuno-biology to further develop next-generation vaccines with improved efficacy. We will diversify the portfolio of new antigens ready for clinical testing by reverse vaccinology and diversify their delivery with new platforms and adjuvants developed using sustainable and improved GMP bio-manufacturing know-how. In parallel, the efficacy of known leading antigens will be benchmarked for the first time using innovative design of clinical studies and CHMI models making these lead candidate vaccines ready for future field trials.

Its eradication is a desirable goal; however, the development of novel intervention strategies is hampered by limited current understanding of the biology of Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, and of its complex interactions with mammalian and mosquito hosts. In the liver, inside hepatocytes, Plasmodium parasites can either 1) replicate, forming new parasites that will infect erythrocytes and cause disease, or 2) remain dormant, which can lead to chronic, relapsing disease weeks to years after the original infection. I recently discovered new hepatic outcomes using a novel pipeline for single-cell hepatocyte-pathogen sequencing. I have identified sub-populations of sexually committed parasite forms, previously thought to appear only during erythrocytic infection. This groundbreaking insight into the Plasmodium life cycle can change our understanding of malaria transmission, yet it remains unknown how malaria parasites commit to these different developmental outcomes in hepatocytes.DEXES will test the hypothesis that Plasmodium liver infection outcomes depend upon the metabolic state of the host hepatocyte. Using engineered human microlivers, new humanized mouse models, trans-species studies and single-cell technologies, I will: 1) identify parasite-encoded molecular mechanisms implicated in the induction and maintenance of dormancy, activation, and sexual conversion in the liver, and 2) establish the bidirectional relationships between host metabolism and distinct parasite cell fates and their impact on treatment outcomes.

This proposal centres around recent data suggesting that JAM-A controls the expression of HER2 and HER3, key tyrosine kinases associated with aggressive breast cancer. I will test the novel hypothesis that combining a JAM-A antagonist and an anti-HER2/HER3 drug (Pertuzumab) exerts synergistic anti-tumour effects in breast cancer settings. This will be accomplished by: Testing the combination of a JAM-A antagonist and an anti-HER2/HER3 antibody for anti-tumor efficacy in 2D and 3D models of breast cancer in vitro; Using chick embryo xenograft assays (cell line-based and patient-derived xenograft-based) to test the combination of a JAM-A antagonist and an anti-HER2/HER3 antibody in vivo; Identifying new JAM-A antagonists and test them for synergism with an anti-HER2/HER3 antibody in breast cancer settings;Validating a possible JAM-A-HER2/HER3 signalling axis in breast cancer patient datasets and samples.

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for almost 15–20% of all breast cancers (300.000 women diagnosed worldwide per year) and is commonly diagnosed in women younger than age 40. TNBC remains a clinical challenge due to high rate of relapse, a propensity to form visceral metastasis and limited targeted therapies. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify novel targeted therapies for the treatment of the TNBC. TargetRANK is based on the innovative idea of generating novel drugs targeting RANK receptor – instead of its ligand RANKL – for the treatment of TNBC, as well as a new panel of anti-RANK human antibodies – for research and diagnostic purposes. Small molecule inhibitors generated during the project could plausibly be positioned as a novel targeted therapy for TNBC and anti-RANK antibodies commercialized for research applications due to the lack of specific antibodies on the market. The most important benefits of TargetRANK are based on the unmet need to improve the treatment of TNBC patients, and the economic burden for public health systems generated by standard non-selected and ineffective cancer treatments. In addition, if drugs against RANK prove to be efficient, TargetRANK derived assets could also clinically benefit most of the patients suffering bone metastasis that are currently treated with bone resorption drugs, denosumab and bisphosphonates. Although our products are aimed for breast cancer, they may be therapeutically relevant for other tumors expressing RANK as non-small cell lung cancer.

Though many interventions to tackle obesity have been proposed, they have rarely been effective. The aim of HealthyW8 is to advance the efficacy of current and future efforts and investments in obesity prevention initiatives across Europe. Most interventions suffer from not adapting to personal context (e.g. socioeconomic aspects, host-biological factors, environment, dietary preferences, fitness level etc.), focus only on diet or physical activity alone, do especially overlook emotional aspects, and fail to engage and motivate the user. Thus, initiatives on obesity prevention in policy and practice are often of marginal impact. HealthyW8 will address these shortcomings by iteratively developing, together with stakeholders, a digital-based healthy lifestyle recommender for evidence-based, tailored interventions and tools including a human digital twin to bridge the gap between science, societal actors and stakeholders (e.g. healthcare professionals, food industries, policymakers) and EU citizens. The targeted populations are those undergoing  transitions, i.e. schoolchildren (5-10 y, and their parents), young adults (18-25 y) and the elderly (>65 y). In the mid-term, we estimate that with 200,000 HealthyW8 users, we will prevent 10,000 obesity cases/y. In the long run, the impact will be maximized through adopting the project’s proposed methodology, platform and tools by as many EU institutions and entities as possible. HealthyW8 is a highly experienced, synergistic and complementary consortium that will built on a previously developed digital dietary app (LIFANA) and draw on transdisciplinary research in pan-EU multicentre pilots and long-term randomized control trials to achieve its overarching objective of increasing impact of current and future obesity prevention interventions and policies in the EU.', 'Obesity: Biological, socioCultural, and environmental risk Trajectories\nObesity in Europe disproportionately affects people and communities with a lower socioeconomic position (SEP). Effective preventive approaches require consideration of the complex and dynamic interplay between (SEP-specific) biological, sociocultural and environmental risk factors of obesity across the life course.   OBCT provides health professionals, researchers, policy makers and the public with knowledge, maps and tools to support sustainable prevention of obesity, with a particular focus on low SEP communities. To achieve this, we quantify the contribution of biological, sociocultural and built environmental risk factors of obesity risks and the interactions in and across various life stages, and translate the resulting knowledge into practical and effective tools for action.    Specifically, OBCT will:  1) Advance the current understanding of obesity risks and predictors, and the role of SEP across the life-course;  2) Determine the importance of specific obesity-related behaviours to prevent obesity at key life stage transitions; 3) Develop a holistic obesity risk screener for use by the public at large and by health professionals; 4) Provide country-specific estimates of trends obesity; 5) Provide a digital atlas on the obesogenicity of environments; 6) Characterise obesity-related cardiometabolic risk profiles over gender, age and SEP;  7) Develop tailored lifestyle recommendations; 8) Determine the impact of obesity-related policies on inequality;  9) Provide a decision support dashboard for policy makers;  10) Provide co-developed toolboxes to support implementation of policy recommendations in low-SEP communities.    OBCT’s outputs highlight where and in which domains obesity is to be targeted, and empower the research community, policymakers, health professionals and citizens to adapt and implement policies to reduce obesity risk, thereby helping to prevent obesity -particularly in low SEP communities - throughout Europe.', 'Fighting childhood obesity to stay healthy all over the life\nObesity rates in late teens have increased in Europe from 6% in 1980 to 32%, with long-lasting effects on the prevalence of severe obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, premature death and disability.

Schizophrenia alone affects approximately 1% of the world's population. The clinical effectiveness of the antipsychotics on the market remains limited with 30 to 50% of schizophrenic patients showing an insufficient response to treatment. Several factors, from genetic to psychological and social, may lie behind poor treatment outcomes or side effects and varies from patient to patient.Therefore, the central aim of the VIRTUAL BRAIN TWIN project is to create an ecosystem for generating virtual brain twins for psychiatric patients, by leveraging the consortium’s detailed knowledge and expertise in neuronal microcircuit simulation, mathematical analysis, innovative AI tools, and psychiatric care and clinical studies. This ecosystem will guide clinicians to optimise medication type and dosage, and to evaluate alternative treatments, such as brain stimulation and lifestyle changes. Multiscale cause-effect simulations and virtual brain simulations based on fMRI or sMRI data from the individual patient, will bridge the gap between molecules and the patient's brain.At the centre of this ecosystem will be the Virtual Brain Twin platform, which will make use of big data, multiscale modelling, and high-performance computing (HPC) that will be secured by appropriate data safety and protection. The platform will be embedded in the European digital neuroscience research infrastructure EBRAINS and will be initially accessible to neuroscientists, clinical researchers, and mathematical modellers, and in the future, to clinicians, and patients as well.

These disorders are strongly genetically intercorrelated, and exhibit pronounced clinical overlap, suggesting that they are different manifestations of a shared underlying neurobiology, along a spectrum. However, the neurobiological mechanisms and pathophysiology of these disorders are still poorly understood, limiting effective drug discovery. There is an urgent need for new models for drug testing, as animal models have major limitations, and current psychiatric organoids systems are dependent on patient derived stem cells, in which technical, genetic and biological diversity confound the interpretation, and obscure the underlying neuropathology. The major challenge of this ERC proposal is to develop organoid models for psychiatric disorders by targeting upstream transcription factors. Transcription factors are key molecules that drive cell type differentiation including neuronal network formation. Hence, the central hypothesis of this ERC proposal is that neuronal subtype associated transcription factors can function as targets to model these disorders using brain organoids. However, the neuronal transcriptional regulators that mediate these disorders are currently unknown, and difficult to identify. Novel genomics technologies allow for an unbiased characterization of the brain in order to detect cell types and genes that are dysregulated in disease, and can be used to identify putative upstream transcription factors. Here, I propose a selection of multi-omics profiling - strategies to a unique collection of high quality psychiatric human brain tissue aimed at reliably identifying key upstream transcription factors. We will subsequently target those transcription factors in brain organoid systems to establish neurobiological models of these disorders.', 'Psych-STRATA - A Stratified Treatment Algorithm in Psychiatry: A program on stratified pharmacogenomics in severe mental illness\nA key problem in Mental Health is that up to one third of patients suffering from major mental disorders develop resistance against drug therapy. However, patients showing early signs of treatment resistance (TR) do not receive adequate early intensive pharmacological treatment but instead they undergo a stepwise trial-and-error treatment approach. This situation originates from three major knowledge and translation gaps:  i.) we lack effective methods to identify individuals at risk for TR early in the disease process, ii.) we lack effective, personalized treatment strategies grounded in insights into the biological basis of TR, and iii.) we lack efficient processes to translate scientific insights about TR into clinical practice, primary care and treatment guidelines. It is the central goal of PSYCH-STRATA to bridge these gaps and pave the way for a shift towards a treatment decision-making process tailored for the individual at risk for TR. To that end, we aim to establish evidence-based criteria to make decisions of early intense treatment in individuals at risk for TR across the major psychiatric disorders of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression. PSYCH-STRATA will i.) dissect the biological basis of TR and establish criteria to enable early detection of individuals at risk for TR based on the integrated analysis of an unprecedented collection of genetic, biological, digital mental health, and clinical data. ii.) Moreover, we will determine effective treatment strategies of individuals at risk for TR early in the treatment process, based on pan-European clinical trials in SCZ, BD and MDD. These efforts will enable the establishment of novel multimodal machine learning models to predict TR risk and treatment response. Lastly, iii.) we will enable the translation of these findings into clinical practice by prototyping the integration of personalized treatment decision support and patient-oriented decision-making mental health boards.']"

The aim and ambition of TRIGGER are to deepen current understanding of the linkage between climate, health and ecosystems (exposome framework) and to use this knowledge to advance society uptake at personal and policy level. To meet the ambition, TRIGGER will commit an interdisciplinary consortium of 22 partners in 15 countries that will develop an outreaching clinical study composed by a multi-dimensional approach that capitalizes also on existing retrospective studies and will build an international climate service for global health protection, in line with COPERNICUS initiatives. TRIGGER strategy is grounded on three pillars: i) trans-disciplinary investigations to build up systemic knowledge ii) integration and usability of research results and iii) development of practical know-how and workable tools to monitor, predict and mitigate risks for human health connected to climate change. The proposal is designed around the creation of 5 newly conceived Climate-Health Connection Labs in Europe that engage citizens, practitioners and policy-makers in a co-creation process. The approach will target areas exposed to adverse impacts of climate change, such as increased heat waves, air pollution and droughts, and will address key health issues such as cardio-vascular diseases, respiratory diseases and UV exposure. By overcoming heterogeneous technological and methodological challenges, TRIGGER will provide exploitable tools to strengthen surveillance mechanisms and risk assessment, to translate robust evidence of climate-environment-health relationships into actionable information and guidelines, to identify and prioritise cost-effective policies and actions.', 'Innovative Solutions across the MEDiterranean for mitigation of Climate change-related heaLth rIsks and enhancing health systeM resilience\nISMED-CLIM aims to engage and mobilise regional stakeholders across the Mediterranean, in implementing a wide array of adaptation solutions to mitigate the health effects of climate change, and provide evidence for their feasibility, user acceptance and efficacy. Specifically, ISMED-CLIM will (i) enhance the understanding of climate change effects on non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and vector-borne infections across representative European countries within the Mediterranean; (ii) quantify, for the first time, how public health interventions integrating state-of-the-art technologies, public and social media, with vulnerable citizens’ participation can reduce personal exposures to heat and air pollution and related health effects; (iii) validate the feasibility and user acceptance among high risk professionals of a regional early warning and risk prediction tool to mitigate the risk posed by exposure to sand flies and related diseases; (iv) employ open, participatory, and co-creative methodologies to locally adapt and refine existing evidence-based practices and prototype tools to increase the preparedness and ability of health systems in the Mediterranean to deliver safe, effective, and efficient care to citizens. We will test the proposed demonstration solutions initially in eight sites and coordinate ten replications in six sites in five European countries (Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal), in alignment with Climate Change Adaptation Mission objectives. We will integrate the produced knowledge from epidemiology, forecasting, exposure and health data with insights from the demonstration and replication activities into a knowledge portal and policy decision-centric and action-oriented dashboard for policy makers, healthcare administrators, professionals and citizens.

This will be achieved through five specific objectives: 1) to develop an integrated indicator framework and repository to track the status of health-relevant outcomes of climate actions; 2) to quantify the health co-benefits and full social and environmental costs and benefits resulting from mitigation measures outside of the health sector; 3) to develop innovative surveillance and forecasting tools that facilitate effective response to environmental health hazards (e.g. heat stress, allergenic pollen) caused by climate change and the design, monitoring and evaluation of interventions to mitigate climate change; 4) to investigate how stakeholders engage with evidence regarding the health impacts of climate change, and to develop strategies and tools to facilitate engagement; and 5) to provide evidence and training on the most effective strategies for climate change adaptation and mitigation for health systems, with specific focus on vulnerable populations including those occupationally exposed to hazards induced by climate change.

Nevertheless, mechanistic preclinical studies in atherosclerosis research world-wide are typically conducted in unchallenged (without MI) atherosclerosis-prone mice and thus do not address the specific pathophysiology of post-MI atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. We conducted a single-cell RNA sequencing coupled to B cell receptor (BCR) sequencing analysis of sorted CD45+ splenocytes from atherosclerosis-prone mice that were fed an atherogenic diet for eight weeks in total and were subjected four weeks after the initiation of the atherogenic diet feeding either to sham microsurgery or to permanent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery to induce MI. We found that splenic mature B lymphocytes from atherosclerotic mice that suffered an MI display altered glucocorticoid-induced responses and a more diversified BCR repertoire, which contains twelve unique clonotypes (named B-MIracle clones) that are not present in atherosclerotic mice without MI. Here, I aim a) to investigate the effect of glucocorticoid-induced signaling in B cells in post-MI atherosclerosis in vivo by employing mouse models that allow the inducible genetic manipulation of different components of the glucocorticoid-induced signaling axis, b) by utilizing the full heavy and light chain nucleotide sequences from our single cell BCR-seq data, to clone and produce the respective antibodies of the B-MIracle clones and examine their effect in accelerated atherosclerosis after MI in vivo, and c) to address the relevance of these findings in atherosclerosis progression in patients with a recent MI, by analyzing sorted peripheral B cell subsets and serum samples. These studies may lead to the identification of precise therapeutic targets for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.', 'Single cEll guided polygeniC Risk prEdicTion of ASCVD\nAtherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the most common cause of death worldwide. Aside from asymptomatic manifestations, the first sign of clinically significant ASCVD is often a severe clinical event, such as stroke or myocardial infarction. Thus, identification of people at high risk is central to battle the deadly consequences of ASCVD. The usefulness of current risk prediction models such as SCORE2 is unsatisfactory most likely since the score is built on prevalent risk factors rather than mechanistic changes occuring along the disease path. Especially, genetic risk factors acting already early in life and diverse longitudinal exposures accumulating during the lifetime of a person, lead to disturbance of gene regulatory networks which are not considered in the current risk models. In addition, the current models predict the combined risk of coronary and peripheral artery disease and ischemic stroke despite mounting evidence of ASCVD heterogeneity. To capture these missing aspects of ASCVD risk, we leverage the predictive ability of genetic variation provided to us by the world’s largest meta-analysis of GWAS for ASCVD and introduce a new disease mechanism-based stratification. In work package (WP) 1, we will map the transcriptomic and epigenetic effects of risk variants using single cell multiomics profiling of 500 human atherosclerotic tissue samples. In WP2, we infer disease associated genes, gene-gene interactions and gene regulatory networks using an innovative CRISPR-based experimental approach. In WP3, we will make use of the generated information to develop novel functionally informed polygenic risk models which are benchmarked against the conventional risk prediction models for predictive accuracy. Ultimately, this information will provide us with a mechanistic understanding of the genetic basis of disease while allowing construction of new gold standard polygenic risk prediction models for prevention of ASCVD events.', ""MultiomIcs based Risk stratification of Atherosclerotic CardiovascuLar disEase\nAtherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Aside from asymptomatic manifestations, the first sign of clinically significant ASCVD is often a severe clinical event, such as stroke or myocardial infarction (MI). Thus, identifying individuals at high risk is crucial in preventing the fatal consequences of ASCVD. Current risk prediction models based on traditional risk factors, such as SCORE2, have limitations since they do not encompass all mechanisms and intermediary phenotypes leading to ASCVD. Particularly, current risk models fail to consider the disturbance of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) caused by genetic risk factors and diverse longitudinal exposures accumulating during a person's lifetime.Furthermore, the current models predict the combined risk of CAD, PAD and ischemic stroke despite mounting evidence of the heterogeneity of the underlying disease mechanisms. To capture the missing aspects of current ASCVD risk scores, MIRACLE project brings together unique data resources and expertise to provide novel multiomics based prediction models of ASCVD. We aim to (1) Integrate the globally largest CAD, PAD, and stroke GWAS information to identify genetic loci that differ between or are shared by these diseases and their subtypes, (2) Identify sex-specific subtypes of ASCVD patients using transcriptomic phenotyping of plaques and circulating biomarkers, (3) Generate functionally informed polygenic risk scores by combining experimental fine-mapping and gene prioritization approaches with integrative GRN and deep learning modelling. (4) Derive novel risk prediction models incorporating polygenic risk and circulating biomarkers. Providing a new gold standard for prediction models to accurately risk stratify stroke and MI represents a technological breakthrough allowing for earlier diagnoses and treatments of ASCVD.""]"
