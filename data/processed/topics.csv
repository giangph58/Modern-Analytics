Diagnosis of respiratory disease comprises a complex assessment of several multiple exams over time that together characterise the patient condition. Streamlined into existing clinical pathways, AI4Lungs will support clinicians and other stakeholders in decision making along the patient journey from initial suspicion to diagnosis, and treatment planning. The models incorporate clinical partners’ multiple data sources, registries and open national/international databases, including multiple data types from medical records, imaging data as well as novel data from digital stethoscope and –omics. AI4Lungs stratification strategy will build computational models employing structured and unstructured data modalities, leading to more accurate positioning of patients and enabling them to benefit from global data and knowledge shared during all stages of care, focusing on diagnosis and treatment planning. With scale up, AI4Lungs will support any patient from any country, any hospital no matter how remote or small, by stratifying them among all of Europe’s patients from that cluster, gaining access to the collective expertise, experience and information on optimal care options. In parallel, health systems will reduce costs and effort in unnecessary testing, ineffective treatments and emergency services, optimizing use of health technologies and resources. AI4Lungs patient stratification tools will focus on respiratory diseases, a complex and broad set of disorders with high disease burden. AI and real world data combined with innovative holistic diseases modelling, will offer a solution for allocating resources more efficiently, making best treatment pipelines accessible to more patients while complying with FAIR principles and relevant regulatory and ethical guidelines.', 'PREPARE aims at advancing rehabilitation care for patients with chronic non-communicable diseases. As rehabilitation is a complex, multifaceted, and highly personal process, we currently lack reliable patient stratification and outcome prediction tools. While big data approaches provide a path forward, existing data sets pose numerous challenges. These challenges can be overcome by combining advances in clinical research, socio-behavioral and public health research, data science, and advanced statistical and AI learning methods.We will apply machine learning techniques on our large-scale patient data sets including key sociodemographic, living conditions, and behavioral information to stratify patients based on expected outcomes. A subsequent analysis will consider all potential predictors for rehabilitation outcome. Baseline strata and modifiers will be used to develop a comprehensive model of each clinical situation to increase management quality, improve outcomes, and reduce costs. As proof of principle we will develop a platform for sharing model results, exploiting the open-science EHDEN platform, and showcase the novel approach through pilot cases of nine pathologies which constitute the most dominant causes for rehabilitation worldwide: hand disorders, hip and knee prosthesis, intermittent claudication, lower limb loss, Parkinson’s disease/Parkinsonisms, scoliosis, spine disorders, temporo-mandibular articulation, and hypertension.

NCD prevention is highly relevant to reduce the need for long-term care. The economic burden is expected to increase by 65% from 2020 to 2040 with a strong negative impact on patients quality of life. SmILE will provide a cross-sectoral, early risk detection methodology by holistic analysis of elderly patients health data. Co-creation with end-users and consideration of diverse needs, mental and physical abilities, living and socio-economic conditions as well as life-situation of older people are implemented. This includes training and enhanced stream of information to patients and other stakeholders. It will offer an AI-based patient analysis, incl. integration of smart wearables and medical devices incl. implants to support monitoring of general health status. Our approach will disrupt the cycle of frailty by minimizing physical decline and risk of re-fractures. To enhance the AI functions, new data sources will be established by instrumenting medical devices, mainly implants, to augment them into monitoring and actively supporting devices. SMILE will: (1) develop an integrated platform to collect, centralize, manage, analyze and share multimorbid geriatric patient data using technology such as AI & machine learning; (2) establish a pan-European bottom-up model of good governance of health data being patient-centered and patient-controlled in line with current regulations; and  (3) establish a solution driven by the needs of citizens and patients of old age. SMILE will establish a new approach of outcome-monitoring to provide patient centered, personalized and integrated treatment of elderly NCD patients to improve quality of life, enable real empowerment and ease the financial burden in an ageing society.']"

However, the inevitable acquisition of resistance mechanisms limits the clinical benefit of these treatments. To fully understand how resistance develops, it is crucial to better integrate tumor heterogeneity, cancer cell plasticity and microenvironment changes by applying cutting-edge single cell technologies directly on sequentially sampled biopsies from cancer patients. Additionally, to achieve deeper and longer-lasting clinical responses for cancer patients, we will need to target the rare drug-tolerant persister cancer cells. Samples collected before, during and after treatment will be used to fully describe the characteristics of the cells that are the source of genetic resistant variants that ultimately give rise to tumor relapses. By combining the establishment of patient-derived models, drug-screening of epigenetic inhibitors, transcriptomic and epigenetic characterization of persister cells we will aim to highlight their vulnerabilities. Finally, identify the driver mechanisms of genomic evolution by elucidating the link between oncogenic kinases and DNA repair pathways activity will be our innovative strategy to exploit putative susceptibilities to impeach the survival of resistant cells. The use of DNA repair substrate combined with CRISPR gene knockout will aim at confirming the value of targeting DNA repair pathways to profoundly transform the outcome of patients with metastatic cancer. Overall, by applying new technological breakthrough at the single cell level on patient biopsies, digging into the intrinsic nature of persister cells and taking advantages of DNA repair defects we will identify innovative treatment strategies to avoid the emergence of resistance in patients.', 'IntroductionCancer cell plasticity, the ability of cancer cells to change their identity, enables tumors to adapt to hostile environments, aiding metastasis and resistance to treatments. Hence, plasticity is a major unsolved problem frustrating effective treatment. Unraveling the mechanisms underlying cancer cell plasticity is crucial to establish new avenues for cancer therapy. In contrast to adult cancers, many pediatric tumors are driven by a single genetic alteration that fuels their aggressive nature through remarkable plasticity. Despite their differences, pediatric cancers offer a unique platform to investigate cancer cell plasticity due to their genetically clear characteristics. I hypothesize that plasticity can be reversed to differentiate tumor cells and “mature cancer”. GoalBuilding upon previous ERC-StG funding, we have successfully utilized organoid technology, single-cell genomics, and lineage tracing approaches to uncover the origins of various pediatric cancers. Our findings revealed that these cancers exhibit robust yet pharmacologically reversible plasticity at the level of the epigenome. The goal of this proposal is to reverse cell state changes during tumorigenesis to “mature cancer”. ApproachWe will I) apply advanced (spatial) single-cell transcriptomics and epigenomics approaches to a unique cohort of pediatric tumors and metastases to map out cell state changes during disease progression, II) utilize our unique pediatric cancer organoids to interrogate and target hierarchical trajectories with the aim to mature cancer, and III) screen the enhancer-ome to identify non-genetic determinants of cancer cell plasticity. InnovationIntegrating these cutting-edge technologies on patient-derived tissues and organoids will uncover fundamental principles governing cancer cell plasticity. The research will pioneer innovative methodologies and reveal strategies for identifying cancer maturation targets, advancing cancer therapy research', 'Cancer is an enormous biomedical challenge, in part due to the complexity of cancer cell dynamics. The combination of intrinsic genetic alterations and cues from the tumour microenvironment impact the cancer phenotype and create heterogeneous tumours that evolve in space and time. Cancer cells develop distinct phenotypes in diverse tumour regions and different metastatic locations. In addition, cancer progression, metastatic dissemination, and development of therapeutic resistance affect cellular interactions over time. Therefore, understanding tumour dynamics is critical for the development of novel therapeutic approaches.Although tumour heterogeneity has been thoroughly investigated at the genomic and transcriptomic levels, limited studies have investigated heterogeneity at the proteomic level. Changes in protein expression are central determinants of cancer phenotypes; developing a detailed understanding of proteome dynamics would be an enormous scientific advancement in the cancer field. However, technological challenges, and specifically, the challenge of analysing single cells and small groups of cells, have delayed progress along these lines. Here, I propose to combine my cutting-edge clinical proteomic expertise and extensive experience in cancer biology to study the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of cancer at the proteomic level.We will push the boundaries of the technology towards assaying thousands of proteins from single cells and small groups of cells from in-vivo samples. We will combine microfluidic probe technology to map primary tumors and metastases at high spatial resolution, and study mouse models of melanoma and breast cancer to follow temporal changes in metastatic growth and treatment response. This breakthrough in proteomic analysis of cancer dynamics will provide the basis for targeting treatment-resistant metastatic cell populations towards advanced personalized treatment.']"

There is a paucity of treatment options for viral respiratory pathogens and patient care remains largely supportive. This underscores a desperate need for identifying novel targets for prophylactic/treatment interventions and early prediction models of disease outcome to personalise treatment. The REACT consortium ? uniting high-level experts in virology, immunology, clinical medicine, epidemiology, and bioinformatics ? will assess genotypic, high-dimensional immunophenotypic, demographic and clinical data in the context of disease course to define host-pathogen interactions of viral respiratory tract infections, focusing on the predominating viruses i.e. influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In characterised, ethnically diverse clinical cohorts comprising patients with varying disease severities, we will genotype both virus and host, map deep immunological phenotypes spanning cellular, humoral and innate immunity, and characterise host responses in human nasal epithelial organoid models following viral infection. Novel bioinformatics approaches that include knowledge discovery and machine learning will be used to integrate and analyse multidisciplinary datasets to assess the individual and combined impact of factors on disease phenotype. Information on the deep characterisation of the dynamics of the immune responses to the chosen viruses and identified factors critical for viral control and immune protection will be made available on a dedicated project website to clinicians, researchers, health authorities, and public. This will provide direct and immediate access to our findings for further development of personalised treatment, therapeutic targets and vaccines in future trials and clinical practice to improve the wellbeing of the EU population and beyond.', 'Bacterial and viral respiratory infections are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Bordetella pertussis, influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2, are responsible for diseases with major public health impact: community-acquired pneumonia, whooping cough, influenza and COVID-19, respectively. Vaccines against some of these diseases, administered by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection, do not prevent colonization or infection of the upper respiratory tract (URT), and therefore have limited impact on pathogen transmission.The NOSEVAC consortium aims to develop and assess innovative nasal vaccine platforms as a novel concept to block the earliest stage of infection, thereby inhibiting URT colonisation, transmission and disease. The project builds on a unique consortium of 12 renowned and complementary teams from the EU, UK and Switzerland.NOSEVAC’s objectives are to:•Develop vaccine formulations for nasal delivery of RNA- and protein-based antigens•Discover bacterial antigens that promote colonization of the URT•Use a combination of in vitro and in vivo models for optimal evaluation of vaccines efficacy•Identify key host immune factors required for long-term protection of the URT in human •Deliver two nasal vaccine candidates to fight S. pneumoniae and B. pertussis infection, and a single bivalent vaccine to prevent influenza and COVID-19•Address acceptability of nasal vaccinationExpected outcomes include (1) strengthening innovation in Europe by enriching the pipeline for novel vaccines against (new) respiratory infections, (2) increasing knowledge on the mechanisms underlying URT colonization, infection and immunity, and (3) evaluating nasal vaccine acceptability by stakeholders. NOSEVAC will develop strategic research avenues to fight respiratory pathogens including those with epidemic potential and will facilitate evidence-based decision making to policy makers and investors.', ""The global COVID-19 pandemic underscores the need to better understand its causative agent, SARS-CoV-2, and the various other emerging viruses threatening human health. Like many human viruses, SARS-CoV-2 utilizes RNA as its replicated genetic material and its template for translating the virus's proteins. Ongoing research into SARS-CoV-2 and other RNA viruses has largely focused on understanding the function of their encoded proteins, revealing key roles in host cell entry, viral replication, and immune suppression. In contrast, little is known about the set of viral RNAs and how they interact with host machinery as part of a virus's replication cycle in infected cells. My group discovered a large collection of viral and host proteins that bind the genomic and subgenomic RNAs of SARS-CoV-2 during infection. This collection provides an excellent starting point to work toward the goal of my proposed ERC Starting Grant project: decoding how these interactions shape the viral RNA life cycle and contribute to antiviral defense mechanisms. My overarching hypothesis is that SARS-CoV-2 dynamically modulates RNA-protein interactions in the host to facilitate functions of genomic and subgenomic viral RNAs at different stages of the replication cycle. To test this hypothesis, I have devised three research objectives:    1) Decode mechanisms of host-mediated control over the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs.  2) Map with temporal resolution which host cell proteins engage each SARS-CoV-2 RNA type.  3) Elucidate the role of host proteins that moonlight as RNA binders in SARS-CoV-2 infections.    If successful, this project will identify novel pro- and antiviral host factors in SARS-CoV-2 infections and reveal underlying RNA regulatory mechanisms. In turn, these insights will provide an RNA-centric view of viral infections and identify candidate factors and pathways as therapeutic targets to treat viral diseases.""]"

To delay AD onset before symptoms development, prevention of neuronal death should be prioritised instead. An early AD pathological event is intraneuronal accumulation of amyloids (intraA) which can cause neuronal death at the pre-plaque stage. IntraA is only found in specific neuronal subtypes first to be lost in AD, suggesting it might underly their selective vulnerability. Reactive microglia  could contribute to intraA as blocking neuroinflammatory processes in early AD reduces its accumulation. Whether microglia also contribute to intraA+ neurons selective loss is still unknown but could suggest repurposing of already available microglia targeting drugs for early neuroprotective therapies. I will test this hypothesis in 5xFAD mice, first confirming intraA accumulates in the neuronal subtypes selectively lost, as it occurs in humans. I will analyse the contribution of reactive microglia to intraA neurons death  by pharmaceutically rescuing their reactivity and determine if intraA neurons-associated microglia express AD high-risk genes, which drive late AD pathology. Because AD affects women more, possibly due to their higher inflammatory response, the sex-specificity in the previous analyses will also be tested. Finally, I will establish microglia-containing human brain organoids to recapitulate this synergy in a in vitro human AD model, providing a foundation for future drug testing.By determining the potentially detrimental interplay between microglia reactivity and intraA+ neurons, using both in vivo and in vitro models, my project will lay the basis of extensive future work while defining my research niche. In the long term, my results will impact development of novel neuroprotective therapies for treating AD before neuronal loss.', 'Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most prevalent deadly neurodegenerative disorder for which no effective treatment exists as of today. Therefore, there is an urgent need to better understand the molecular mechanisms behind AD in order to develop more effective treatments against this complex disease. Recent genetic findings have highlighted several AD-associated genes, many of which are preferentially expressed in microglia in the brain. One of these is tetraspanin 14 (TSPAN14), whose physiological function in the brain is not yet understood. Recent studies suggest that TSPAN14 may act as a functional regulator of ADAM10, a transmembrane protease that cleaves multiple substrates in the brain including the AD-associated protein TREM2. Full-length TREM2 is essential for the phagocytic activity of microglia and its cleavage by ADAM10 results in loss of function. The central aim of the TSPAN14-AD project is to understand how TSPAN14 controls molecular pathways involved in AD, by focusing on proteolysis and function of TREM2. Specifically, we hypothesize that TSPAN14 increases AD risk by modulation of TREM2 cleavage and microglial phagocytosis. The 3 objectives of TSPAN14-AD are to: (1) determine whether AD-protective TSPAN14 alternative splicing variants result in reduced TSPAN14 protein expression; (2) elucidate whether reduced TSPAN14 expression results in decreased ADAM10 cell surface expression; (3) assess whether loss of TSPAN14 reduces TREM2 cleavage and enhances phagocytic activity of microglia. To accomplish this, a combination of biochemical, molecular, and proteomic techniques will be used within both in vitro and in vivo models, including human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia and post-mortem human brain tissue. Outcomes of the project have the potential to fill in a large gap in our current understanding of molecular mechanisms leading to AD pathogenesis and may provide insight into novel therapeutic targets for AD and related disorders.', ""The molecular mechanisms leading to Alzheimer's disease (AD) are poorly understood. This is due to lack of human tissue samples for research representing early changes of AD pathology. The accumulating pathology, including beta-amyloid and tau proteins, are manifested by concomitant neuroinflammatory reactions geared by malfunctional microglia. Microglia in the human and mouse AD brain exist in various subpopulations from which a specific, disease-associated microglia population is thought to be involved in AD pathogenesis. However, there is no evidence on whether and how these specific microglial subpopulations actually impair neuronal functions in human AD brain. I will now assess neuron-glia network activities and functions indicative of early AD pathology in humans. I hypothesize that early AD pathology selectively impairs neuronal circuits and that glial cells, especially specific microglia subpopulations, contribute to neuronal dysfunction and cognitive decline. These events contribute to a detectable vesicle-based biomarker profile in cerebrospinal fluid and blood prior the clinical disease. Due to early AD pathology present in a subpopulation of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) patients, the brains of the iNPH patients offer a unique window to evaluate cellular and molecular events occurring during early AD. I combine a series of state-of-the art techniques to answer how and what glial cell subpopulations are associated with altered neuronal network activities at subcellular and spatial resolution in human brain impacted by early AD-related pathology. Novel methodologies established in my lab, knowhow and access to unique brain samples make me uniquely positioned to form a holistic view on how early AD-pathology impacts cellular functions at multiple levels. This will pinpoint novel molecular targets for further validation and new fluid biomarkers.""]"

Myocardial infarction is the most common cause of cardiac insufficiency, leading to fibrosis and ultimately heart failure. Since current therapies for cardiac fibrosis have limitations, there is a need for more effective strategies. Gliflozins (e.g., Dapagliflozin and Empagliflozin), hypoglycemic agents and SGLT2 inhibitors usually used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, have been shown in recent clinical trials (i.e., DAPA-HF, DELIVER, EMPEROR-Reduced, EMPEROR-Preserved) to reduce the combined risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure in patients with reduced and preserved ejection fraction, regardless of diabetes status. They have also been shown to ameliorate myocardial fibrosis post-ischemia. Nevertheless, most of the underlying mechanisms of these benefits remain elusive and the potential adverse effects of the systemic administration of gliflozins must be recognised. In this regard, the use of liposomes as in situ injectable drug delivery systems offers many potential advantages for the therapy of myocardial infarction. Therefore, the SAVETHEHEART project aims to develop a new therapeutic approach for the efficient treatment of cardiac fibrosis by using liposomes, produced by microfluidics to encapsulate Dapagliflozin (DAPA). Their effect will be studied in a 3D model of cardiac fibrosis, that will be obtained by bioprinting a biomimetic type I collagen hydrogel, bioengineered with human induced pluripotent stem cells-derived cardiomyocytes, myofibroblasts and endothelial cells, and cultured under perfusion and hypoxic conditions to better mimic a fibrotic response. Understanding cell behaviour in the proposed setting, this work opens perspective to the optimization of injectable DAPA-liposome formulations, intended as an innovative therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cardiac fibrosis.', 'Heart failure is a major global public health problem affecting over 23 million patients worldwide. There are no effective therapies for heart failure that regenerate the damaged heart muscle following injury such as a myocardial infarction. The adult mammalian heart has an extremely limited intrinsic capacity for regeneration due to the fact that mature cardiomyocytes are unable to proliferate. To date, attempts to re-induce proliferation in mature cardiomyocytes of the adult heart have not yet been translated into the human clinical context. Much remains to be learned about molecular mechanisms controlling cardiomyocyte proliferation in humans if the therapeutic potential for cardiac regeneration is to be realised. With my extensive training and expertise in molecular and stem cell biology I plan to generate and exploit an innovative live cell cycle reporter-based screening platform to identify Transcription Factors (TFs) that can be induce cardiomyocyte proliferation. The three major objectives of this research proposal are: 1. Develop a high-content screening system to monitor cardiomyocyte proliferation in 3D human cardiac organoids, which will then be used to:2. Identify (combinations of) TFs that drive the human cardiomyocyte cell cycle.3. Assess the therapeutic potential of TF activation for cardiac regeneration in a pre-clinical human cardiac model system. I will receive extensive training in the ex vivo cardiac tissue culture system (objective 3), which will complement my proven expertise in the generation of (genetically modified) 3D cardiac organoids and knowledge on cell cycle regulation (objective 1 & 2). Altogether, the tool development, results and training obtained during this project will put me in the forefront of the cardiac regenerative field.', 'Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide, accounting roughly for 45% of all deaths in Europe and costing billions of euros to the European Union economy. Among these, most cardiovascular diseases, such as myocardial infarction, lead to the formation of heart scarring, which is the formation of fibrotic tissue that impairs contractility and cardiac function, ultimately causing heart failure. Despite the prevalence and serious consequences of heart fibrosis, current benchmark therapies have low long-term efficacy, and alternative novel therapies that have reached clinical testing still present severe limitations or lead to little improvement in cardiac function. Thus, there is still an urgent unmet need for the development of novel and efficient therapies for cardiac fibrosis. Cutting-edge research regarding the use of stem cells or delivery of molecules to induce cardiomyocyte proliferation are yet to be successful, as most of these therapies present challenges regarding immunogenicity, efficiency, and long-lasting effect. Thereby, MyoNanoCell project aims at developing a radically new platform for heart fibrosis and cardiac regeneration. By using a combinatory approach, where the MyoNanoCell nanohybrids incorporate not only the ability to carry different cardiomyogenic molecules, but also the ability to modulate the cardiac microenvironment and recognize cardiac fibroblasts, MyoNanoCell will radically increase therapeutic efficiency. Moreover, the simultaneous modulation of cardiac microenvironment and its repopulation with cardiomyocytes by fibroblast reprogramming will directly impact contractility and heart function, representing a paradigm shift in cardiac fibrosis therapy. MyoNanoCell will be fully characterized in vitro to have a full biological fingerprint on the process of cell identity shift, and also tested in advanced 3D in vitro models, to evaluate its overall effects at tissue level.']"

For decades, physicians have relied on polymyxins as a last line of defense to treat resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections that do not respond to standard antibiotic therapies. However, in 2016, a new polymyxin resistance mechanism surfaced: mobilized colistin resistance (MCR-1). The global overuse of antibiotics, including polymyxins, and a persistent lack of novel antibiotics have made us vulnerable to increased bacterial resistance, including the MCR-1 strains, seriously threatening our public health.   In Project PREVAIL, our group will validate the effectiveness of a novel drug, Laterocidamide (LATERO), from a new class of antibiotics to deliver an innovative solution that can mitigate the alarming global surge of antibiotic resistance.

Moreover, our robust synthetic approach will allow us to generate additional analogs in the future. In PREVAIL, we will explore LATERO's technical and commercial potential. Specifically, we will validate LATERO as a novel antibiotic for (multi-drug-resistant) Gram-negative bacterial infections by performing in vitro and in vivo efficacy and preclinical toxicity studies. In parallel, we will: 1. Analyze the IP position and develop an IP rights strategy to protect LATERO and new analogs developed in the project to secure future assets. 2. Evaluate LATERO’s commercial feasibility and construct viable business cases to enter the market to support outreach and procuring future funding opportunities."", 'We are proposing a 4-year program of knowledge transfer and networking between academic institutions [University of Leicester (UK), University of Valencia (Spain), International Iberian Nanotechnology Lab (Portugal), University of Bologna (Italy), University of Aveiro (Portugal), Fudan University (China), and Alfred University (USA)] and industrial partners [Teer Coatings Ltd (UK)].  The objective of the proposed joint exchange programme is to establish long-term stable research cooperation between the partners with interdisciplinary expertise and knowledge to develop Advanced Multidisciplinary Research for Antimicrobial Resistance (AMRAMR), including the development of novel antibacterial nanomaterials and nanostructures, novel antibacterial thin films coatings, upconversion technology for AMR applications, photonics technology for AMR application, and evaluation of the antibacterial performance and antimicrobial resistance; the synergetic effect for the above approaches to understanding antimicrobial resistance.  Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) refers to the ability of microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites, to resist the effects of antimicrobial drugs, such as antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals, and antiparasitics. AMR is a serious global public health threat that could lead to increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs.World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared that AMR is one of the top 10 global public health threats facing humanity.  The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of AMR as it has led to increased use of antimicrobial drugs, particularly antibiotics, which can contribute to the development of AMR. People with COVID-19 may develop secondary bacterial infections, such as pneumonia, and may be prescribed antibiotics to treat these infections. However, unnecessary use of antibiotics can lead to the emergence and spread of resistant bacteria, making it more difficult to treat infections in the future.', 'Since the discovery of penicillin people were living in justified confidence that available antibiotics can cure any bacterial infections. Emerging antibiotic resistance was usually overcome by treatment with new generation of antibiotics, but during last decades bacteria are clearly winning this race. Overuse of antibiotics, particularly in agriculture, and lack of investments in discovery of new antibiotics lead us to situation when increasing number of bacterial infections cannot be cured due to lack of effective remedy. Antibiotic resistance surveillance revealed rising antibiotic resistance around the world. WHO predicts that if no appropriate actions are taken by 2050 antibiotic resistance will be responsible even for 10 mln deaths every year. To address this urgent medical need new antibiotics and alternative methods of combating antibiotic resistant bacteria are needed. One of the new approaches which is getting more and more interests among academic and industrial research groups are enzybiotics, bacteriolytic enzymes that in a very effective and selective way eliminate bacteria, including antibiotic resistant strains, at the same time displaying very low resistance prevalence. Enzybiotx provides a deep-tech platform for tailor made-enzybiotics targeting specific bacteria.  Our company has developed the platform for design and generation of new enzybiotcs to target pathogenic bacteria of interest as an answer to the need of alternative antimicrobials development. The company in collaboration with potential clients is able to prepare tailor-made enzybiotics which target pathogens and in collaboration with the client, perform all tests needed to adjust enzyme’s properties to be able to introduce them to the final products. The founders of the company are experienced academics who have gathered unique expertise in isolation and characterisation of new enzybiotics.']"

Due to considerable shortcomings of the current best practices in treating bone FNUs, patients are facing increased risks and morbidity. The market has available only bone substitutes and enhancers with limited clinical efficiency, highlighting an essential need for more effective therapies. Genera Research is on its way to filling the gap with its globally patented OSTEOGROW-C product: a novel biological drug transforming patients blood into bone. The proposed OSTEOforUNION project aims to develop and commercialize OSTEOGROW-C, an innovative drug for bone regeneration. OSTEOGROW-C is a novel treatment option for bone FNUs, an implant composed of an active substance - recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein 6 (rhBMP6) incorporated in an autologous blood coagulum (ABC) where tricalcium phosphate (TCP) ceramics is added as a compression resistant matrix (CRM). This combination forms a personalized implant that catalyzes bone growth at the implantation site. It is easily prepared in the operating room from the patient's blood without the need for a painful bone harvesting procedure, as in current treatment practices, with associated complications and morbidities (donor site pain, infection, nerve injuries, blood loss or iliac wing fracture etc.) and related additional healthcare costs. OSTEOGROW-C targets the global FNU market, which serves 6M patients yearly. Key overlapping markets are Fracture Fixation, Orthobiologics, Bone Grafts, and BMP. OSTEOGROW-C's unique stance promises to revolutionize the FNU market. The initial market entry will concentrate on the markets in the EU with 180.000 diagnosed long bone FNUs in Europe annually.

Ageing bones fail more easily when challenged mechanically or with toxicants or pollutants, and respond differently to drugs than healthy bone. To personalize therapies and enable better preventive care for the elderly it is essential to develop reliable and sustainable in vitro models of aged bone tissue alternative to animal tests which often fail to capture human-specific features. Several scientific studies support the idea that in vitro models of bone tissue are an outstanding resource for (i) the comprehension of bone physiology, (ii) a better understanding of pathological pathways in most bone dysfunctions, (iii) testing new or repurposed drugs for bone treatment before preclinical trials with animal models.The networking activities planned in OSTEONET will unravel and share knowledge on the mechanisms driving the information transfer from the biochemical and biomechanical levels, which drive osteosynthesis and osseointegration, to the cascade of molecular and cellular events emerging as an elaborated and physiological bone, and on the mechanisms of the different response of healthy and aged bone tissue to mechano-biological stimuli and drugs.', ""3D bioprinting is an emerging technique that offers promise for fabricating implantable tissues. Despite significant advancements, the field struggles to replicate the mechanical robustness and biological complexity of native tissues, particularly in applications requiring high mechanical strength such as bone. This proposal introduces 'BioForceInk,' a bioactive reinforcing bioink designed for direct bioprinting alongside a cell-laden hydrogel within a cell-conductive environment. The microparticle-based bioink is printable at room temperature and solidifies at 37°C, forming a stiff, porous scaffold within the construct. Our preliminary studies demonstrated its excellent printability, mechanical properties, and osteoconductive capabilities in a hybrid bioprinting context. To enhance vascularized bone differentiation in vitro and support bioprinted implant integration and bone recovery in vivo, the bioink will be enriched with osteogenic and vasculogenic factors.Throughout this project, we aim to develop the growth factor-loaded BioForceInk and utilize it for creating vascularized bone implants by hybrid bioprinting in tandem with cell-laden soft bioink. We will then evaluate the regenerative potential of the bioprinted vascularized bone implants in a critical-size bone loss model. Additionally, we plan to test the technology with industrial partners and prepare it for commercialization by the end of the project. BioForceInk offers a unique combination of mechanical support and biological activity that facilitates the single-step fabrication of physiologically relevant bone implants. This innovation has the potential to significantly narrow the gap between bioprinting technology and clinical application, contributing to the development of personalized, mechanically robust, and biologically functional bone implants. With its tunable properties, BioForceInk could be further adapted for bioprinting of various tissues, reflecting its broad potential across the field.""]"

Bacterial biotransformation reactions, the chemical modification of compounds by bacteria, seem to play a central role in such metabolic interplay between the gut microbiota and its human host. A number of gut microbial biotransformations such as reductive and hydrolytic reactions, as well as their metabolic enzymes, have been recently described. The natural roles of these biotransformation pathways in bacterial metabolism and their influence on host physiology have been associated with gut bacterial fitness, nutrition uptake, immune signaling, as well as personal drug response and toxicity. Despite these important functions, our mechanistic and physiological understanding remains still limited for many gut microbial biotransformation reactions, such as chemical conjugation. To fill this knowledge gap, I present a multidisciplinary plan to systematically investigate conjugative biotransformation reactions of gut bacteria.  I will develop mass spectrometry-based methods to identify gut bacterial species and strains that perform conjugative biotransformations, employ high-throughput gut bacterial genetics to identify the responsible genes, determine their role in bacterial metabolism, and eventually assess selected examples for their impact on microbiota-host interactions in gnotobiotic mouse models. If successful, this project will provide novel insights into gut microbial metabolism, and pave new ways to develop strategies for the rational manipulation of gut microbial community functions for better health outcomes.

Despite its key relevance for a holistic understanding of the human superorganism and its (patho-)physiology, how local host-microbiome interactions form specific niches in the gut and how these niches function at the cellular and molecular level remains unexplored, mainly due to a lack of suitable technologies.To fill this gap, we propose to jointly reconstruct the host transcriptional and microbiome compositional landscape of the human gut across a large number of healthy individuals as well as IBD and CRC patients. For this, we will leverage a combination of novel spatial profiling technologies for unbiased transcriptome sequencing and microbiome profiling at single-cell resolution in situ. First, we will spatially delineate local niches formed of specific microbes and host cells. To dissect this complex crosstalk into specific interactions, we will secondly use in vitro and in vivo models to introduce perturbations either on the host or the microbiome side. Finally, we will integrate the resulting data to deconvolute host-microbiome circuits computationally and to predict functional niches, in particular host responses to pathogens of relevance in IBD and CRC. Interesting predictions will be tested in organoid and animal models. Developing a spatially resolved computational model of the gut ecosystem will allow us to predict early local events in disease onset; from these we will identify and validate prognostic IBD and CRC biomarkers for future clinical translation.This work will revolutionize our understanding of intestinal host-microbiome interactions by adding a first-ever functionally resolved spatial dimension with clinical relevance for the future diagnosis and treatment of intestinal disorders.', 'Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, are immune-related disorders characterized byinappropriate gut inflammation. Their incidence has increased dramatically in Western countries in recent decades, supporting a rolefor environmental factors. Despite the development of new treatments, IBD are insufficiently controlled in a large proportion ofpatients, inducing an alteration in quality of life and a socioeconomic burden. A better understanding of the pathogenesis andidentification of new therapeutic targets are therefore urgently needed. In this context, the gut microbiota has been recognized as astrong actor in IBD. Additionally, an alteration in intestinal and immune cell energy metabolism has been suggested in thepathogenesis. Classical host-microbe interaction concepts rely on the recognition of conserved microbial motifs by innate immunitysensors or on the action of microbial molecules on a host cell receptor. However, energy metabolism plays a crucial role in mountingthe appropriate cellular response, and emerging data indicate that the gut microbiota may directly affect it. I hypothesize that thealtered gut microbiota in IBD contributes to the impairment of host cell energy metabolism and pathogenesis. The aims ofENERGISED are to (i) identify the microorganisms and microbiota-derived metabolites impacting host cell energy metabolism and themechanisms involved and (ii) decipher the consequences of gut microbiota alterations on host cell energy metabolism in IBD anddesign new microbiota-based therapeutic strategies to manipulate the host cell energy state in IBD.This challenging project involves multidisciplinary aspects from microbiology to immunology, metabolism, and medicine; the use ofmultiple cutting-edge technologies; and translational analysis from mice to humans.

A significant part of our visual stimulations is however generated by our own actions, rather than external events. For example, the retina can experience similar visual stimulus driven by head-movement, or by a moving object. Therefore, self-motion related information is fundamental to contextualize visual stimuli. In other words, what the eye sees may not be what our brain perceives depending on our actions. In mammals, the vestibular system reports both the motion and orientation of the head. Very little is known about the pathways connecting the vestibular system to visual cortical areas, and how this signal is integrated with external visual stimuli to ultimately impact behaviour. The goal of this project is to unravel the neuronal circuits underlying visual processing during self-motion in mice, thereby providing new insights in sensory processing. To this aim, I will address the following questions: 1) What is the long-range and local connectivity of neurons modulated by head rotation in V1; 2) What are the circuit mechanisms and neuronal computations involved in the integration of self-motion related signals with visual inputs in V1; 3) How do head motion inputs to V1 influence visually-guided actions during behaviour. Achieving these goals relies on a multidisciplinary experimental strategy based on cutting-edge approaches to monitor and control circuit activity with high spatio-temporal resolution in a cell-type specific manner, neuroanatomical tracing, and computational modelling. This experimental strategy combined with my research background in visual and vestibular systems provides a unique opportunity to understand unexplored aspects of sensory processing, at both the cellular and systems levels. Altogether, this project will reveal a novel framework to understand how sensory processing operates during self-motion to guide behaviour.', 'A paramount component of intelligence is our ability to extract useful information in the world through our sensory observations. Object recognition is a fundamental problem in visual perception: every day we depend on our ability to identify objects in our visual environment, and our brain is capable of accomplishing it effortlessly and in a fraction of a second, in spite of immense variation in the sensory information that arrives in our retinas. Understanding the algorithm that the brain uses to do this complex task is a decisive conquest in neuroscience but in order to understand ethologically relevant visual processing, we need to understand how it drives behavior. Despite significant progress characterizing visual processing, we do not understand how the visual system solves visual inference problems in natural environments and we are still far from having a complete understanding of how the brain creates untangled transformation-invariant object representations in the perceptual/visual domain, that can subsequently be used to guide behavior. The proposed research effort aims to (i) create a state-of-the-art behavioral virtual navigation system for mice, (ii) combine it with recent advanced functional brain recording techniques and sophisticated neural data analysis to study how objects are represented in the activity of large populations of neurons across the visual hierarchy and beyond and (iii) causally relate these representations to the behavior of the animal. The outcomes of this project will provide significant insights into the computations used by the mouse visual cortex to extract relevant features from the environment, identify how distinct features are represented across the mouse visual areas and how in turn these representations guide the behavior of the animals.', 'Every second, millions of bits of information enter our eyes. How does the brain identify task-relevant information from this gigantic input stream? This key challenge of the visual system is tackled by substantially processing the sensory input for behavioral relevance. Already in the retina, the front-end of the visual system, neuronal circuits extract multiple features from the environment and form up to 40 channels to the brain. So far, however, one of the basic principles underlying vision, namely how the brain processes these multiple channels from the eye, remains fundamentally unclear.In this proposal, I will focus on the superior colliculus, an evolutionary conserved retino-recipient brain area critically involved in visuomotor transformations, and solve the following problem: How do neuronal circuits in mouse superior colliculus integrate retinal signals to drive behavior? I will implement an interdisciplinary approach that combines population imaging of neuronal activity in behaving mice with optogenetic manipulations, deep neural network modeling, and quantitative behavioral analysis. By modeling a defined brain area all the way from the retinal input to its role in behavior in an ecological setting, I will mechanistically dissect the behavioral relevance of retinal circuits.My work will uncover general principles of how diverse retinal channels are represented in downstream targets, identify elemental convergence rules of feedforward retinal signals in postsynaptic neurons, and causally link retinal function to distinct behaviors. If successful, my proposal will reveal fundamental neuronal and computational mechanisms used by the visual system to convert a complex visual input into action. My approach can be adapted to other sensory modalities, guiding the design of innovative experiments and analyses. The identified mechanisms of efficient information processing will also contribute to the development of robust neuro-inspired artificial intelligence.']"

This process induced changes in plant traits that produced plants that grew faster and generated higher yields. However, remarkably little is known about how plant roots have changed throughout the domestication process. Climate change is causing increasing droughts in many parts of the world. Given that roots are the way that water enters the plant, they are key for understanding drought tolerance. Root traits from crop ancestors could offer a route to increasing drought tolerance of modern crops. To do this, we need to focus our efforts on the impact of domestication on roots and the rhizosphere (the zone around the root including microbes), rather than only aboveground traits as traditionally done. WILD-ROOTS will therefore test the overall hypothesis that crop domestication led to changes in root and rhizosphere traits which decreased the drought tolerance of crops compared to their wild relatives. WILD-ROOTS will make a holistic study of the roots and rhizospheres of a wide range of crops from diverse origins. There will be a focus on root exudation and volatile organic compound (VOC) emission, which are vital root processes that are crucial for many types of interactions with plants, animals, microbes and the soil itself. Changes in root exudates and VOCs have been observed during drought conditions, but their roles in the drought tolerance of plants remains unclear. WILD-ROOTS will (1) evaluate domestication effects on the roots and rhizosphere, then (2) elucidate the mechanisms relating belowground traits to drought tolerance, and finally (3) use this knowledge to modernise crop models and identify belowground traits to be exploited for drought-proofing current crops. The results will reshape our fundamental knowledge of both the crop domestication process and how root exudation influences drought tolerance, as well as offering new approaches to boost the food security of current and future agricultural systems.', 'Agriculture, which underpins the livelihoods of over 2.5 billion people, is nowadays confronted with an array of new threats including plant pests.

The understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlaying plant pathogen interaction and defence responses is not only a fundamental scientific challenge, but it is also relevant to practical applications. Despite decades of research on host-pathogen interactions, knowledge on fundamental aspects of the plant immune system is still missing. This proposal provides an excellent opportunity to help filling this gap of knowledge as it targets the question of how cells translate molecular pathogen recognition into immune cell death, and how dying cells and their neighbours communicate to tightly control this process and ensure the proper balance in between defence responses and plant growth and fitness. To address this question, I have designed a multidisciplinary and international project using Arabidopsis thaliana plant as a model system to study the molecular determinants of plant immune cell death zonation and the involvement of plant metacaspases, distant relatives of animal caspases, in cell death. A plethora of techniques including molecular and biochemistry techniques, plant phenotyping and engineering, FACS and cell biology microscopy techniques will be used for the proper execution of this project. In addition to generate high-impact knowledge in plant immunity that will ultimately impact on society, this proposal will provide me with the expertise, resources, training, and network to become extremely competitive in the field of molecular plant pathology, helping me to progress in my scientific career and to achieve my scientific goals.']"

Researching ways to modulate specific cortical motor rhythms could lead to discovering more effective approaches to treat patients with neurological disorders affecting their motor condition. However, our current understanding tools are insufficient to access and interact with this kind of neural activity. Non-invasive neuromodulation protocols such as transcutaneous Spinal Cord Stimulation (tSCS) are raising interest in recent years to induce changes in the Central Nervous System (CNS) that can lead to functional improvement, while the side effects and applicability limitations of invasive procedures are overcome. Better understanding the interaction between neuromodulation protocols and brain rhythms is crucial for the development of interventions targeting pathological circuits which can favour plastic changes and the restoration of impaired motor functions. In RhytMods, I will develop a non-invasive neuromodulation platform to apply closed-loop stimulation protocols synchronized with brain oscillations decoded from the periphery with muscle recordings (high-density electromyography, HD-EMG). The platform will allow to explore the modulatory effects of brain-oscillations-dependent stimulation of the CNS to treat motor symptoms and its potential to entrain and disrupt neural oscillations linked to motor recovery in patients with PD. This research has the potential to transform our understanding of neurological disorders with pathological brain oscillations and to develop new minimally invasive and cost-effective technologies to treat the motor symptoms in neural disorders.']"

Deregulated endogenous glucose production (EGP) is involved in hyperglycemia and its complications. Among the 3 organs (liver, kidney, intestine) contributing to EGP, I uncovered with my team that intestinal gluconeogenesis (IGN) has the capacity to interfere in the control of energy homeostasis. Indeed, intestinal glucose initiates a gut-brain circuit controlling both body weight and glucose production by the liver, the strongest quantitative contributor to EGP. Intestinal gluconeogenesis is, thus, a novel target to control obesity and diabetes. The IGN project has 3 objectives:Understand: is dedicated to elucidating the neural mechanisms by which IGN is sensed and send its signals to the brain. Our data suggested that glucose receptor sodium-glucose co-transporter 3 (SGLT3) could be the peripheral sensor of IGN. Moreover, we showed that the neuromediator calcitonin gene-related peptide alpha (CGRPa) is mandatory for the IGN signal. I will use original mouse models to map the SGLT3-neuron connection to the brain and define the role of CGRPa.Explore: aims at expanding the scope of IGN to the networking of hypothalamus during the neonatal period. I will assess whether the surge of IGN occurring during the neonatal period may control the development of neuronal connections between the hypothalamic nuclei, to ensure an optimal control of energy homeostasis in adult, as previously observed for the neonatal surge of the hormone leptin. Take advantage: aims at identifying novel metabolites able to activate IGN and test them as beneficial modulators of energy homeostasis under unbalanced nutrition. This will pave the way to novel therapeutic approaches of metabolic diseases based on IGN.Thus, the IGN project should lead to a better understanding of metabolic control and offer new perspectives for preventing metabolic diseases and maintaining healthy ageing.', 'Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) therapy was shown to regenerate β-cells in mice, but this did not translate to human. Early or intensive insulin therapy maintains residual β-cell function, but also causes weight gain and hypoglycaemia. Thus, currently no drug treatment can safely stop the progression of diabetes, a disease characterized by loss or dysfunction of insulin-producing β-cells.In breakthrough discoveries we identified the insulin inhibitory receptor (inceptor) as a druggable target for β-cell insulin sensitization and protection without the side-effects of insulin. Moreover, we combined GLP-1-mediated safe β-cell delivery of estrogen together with 60% reduced insulin therapy to restore β-cell function for diabetes remission. The overarching goal of BetaRegeneration is to explore new avenues of targeted and combinatorial β-cell protection and regeneration therapy.In Aim 1 we will reveal whether inceptor, beside desensitizing the insulin receptor, has also a function as insulin receptor in starvation/stress-induced insulin degradation and as scavenger receptor for insulin lysosomal degradation. This will reveal if inceptor can be targeted to enhance β-cell insulin sensitization, secretion and function.In Aim 2 we will translate our basic findings to in vivo animal and human model systems to explore GLP-1-mediated β-cell delivery and targeting of WNT and β-cell insulin/IGF1 signaling to enhance specificity and target several pathways at once. Furthermore, we will genetically and pharmacologically target inceptor and test if monoclonal antibodies alone or as drug conjugates can promote β-cell protection and regeneration. Our approach will reveal if combinatorial targeting of survival and regenerative pathways can stop β-cell loss and dysfunction.Taken together, the identification of clinically relevant targets and ways of combinatorial β-cell protection and regeneration therapy could open new avenues to stop and revert diabetes progression.', 'Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has reached epidemic proportions, killing millions each year; however, our incomplete understanding of its etiology hinders the quest for a cure. T2D is caused by pancreatic β-cell failure and insulin resistance. Recent studies point to aberrant islet inflammation as a driver of diabetes. While inflammation is beneficial for insulin secretion during homeostasis, it may transform to harm β-cell function and impair the glucose response. How islet inflammation maintains glucose homeostasis and why it converts to being destructive remain largely open questions. Here, I introduce a novel physiological mechanism, pericyte-orchestrated islet inflammation (PIIN), which is disturbed by diabetes risk factors to cause β-cell failure. To establish its requirement for β-cell function, we will first define the role of PIIN in homeostasis. We will then determine how T2D environmental risks, such as obesity and aging, hamper pericyte cytokine production and transform islet inflammation to cause β-cell dysfunction. Lastly, we will link T2D genetic risk factors with aberrant PIIN. To this end, we will analyze human and mouse tissues and use transgenic models to manipulate cells and genes to define the effect of PIIN on β-cell function. Ultimately, our findings will provide a mechanism through which T2D risk factors induce β-cell failure and promote disease progression. The implications of this project are far-reaching, as they will introduce a novel cellular mechanism that integrates metabolic and genetic risks to cause diabetes. Furthermore, our findings will implicate PIIN as a novel target for new therapeutic approaches to diabetes.']"

At present, more than two-thirds of prescription drugs contain at least one chiral center. However, the late-stage introduction of this structural motif using aromatic C–H bonds is an enduring challenge in synthesis. The goal of the NAKED-C project is to develop a new methodology for the construction of chiral centers in drug molecules, relying on the design and synthesis of a novel class of atomic carbon precursors that, upon successive and appropriate activations, would allow to build tailored asymmetric carbons. To achieve this goal, a new visible-light photoredox catalytic diazomethylation of aromatic C–H bonds will be developed. The collaboration with an industrial partner (secondment at AiCuris) will allow the application of this novel strategy to drug discovery in the search of effective antibiotics, thus merging multidisciplinary aspects with intersectoral knowledge transfer. The result will be a brand-new ‘assembly point’ for the construction of chiral centers in bioactive compounds, with the potential to become a late-stage diversity-generating synthetic platform for drug discovery programs. The proposal merges the host expertise in novel C−H functionalization strategies based on photocatalysis, and the researcher’s background in classical radical chemistry, metal-mediated synthesis and pharmacology, ensuring the two-way transfer of knowledge between the fellow and the host group. Successful development of NAKED-C will enhance the scientific and transferable skills of the researcher, while forthcoming to the fellow’s professional goal of pursuing an independent research career in academia in synthetic organic chemistry.', 'The development of enantioselective strategies is becoming highly important as the global chiral chemicals market is expected to reach 120 billion USD by 2025. Among these chiral molecules, β2-amino acids and their derivatives are highly demanding chemicals because of their extensive uses in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals. My SYNERGISTIC proposal will envisage the functionalization of challenging alkenes  and CO2 to achieve chiral β2-amino acids under energy-efficient photocatalytic conditions. To achieve this chemistry, I propose a novel approach by employing two different catalysts to activate simultaneously the double bond of alkene and to insert CO2 into the double bond.  I will use a metal-free photocatalyst in combination with a halogen atom transfer (XAT) reagent to activate the double bond of alkene, and a homogeneous chiral transition metal complex to insert the CO2 molecule in a face-selective way. The mild reaction conditions of photoredox catalysis should enable to functionalize a wide range of alkenes as well as for late-stage functionalization of ‘functionally challenging’ molecules found in natural products and complex pharmaceuticals. This proposal will significantly contribute to the advancement of the ‘CO2-valorization’ blueprint as well as will create a groundbreaking ‘green approach’ for the synthesis of chiral  β2-amino acids using CO2 as a C1 synthon. More importantly, the fundamental new insights of this novel catalytic system that will be gained during this investigation will be a game-changer for the enhancement of sustainable chemistry.', 'In the last 20 years, palladium-catalyzed C–H activation has emerged as a useful alternative to traditional cross-coupling methods and a powerful tool to access valuable intermediates for the synthesis of complex functional molecules. The biaryl fragment is one of the most frequent units present in bioactive molecules, functional organic materials and natural products. Despite major advances, significant limitations persist with regard to their preparation, in term of reactivity, selectivity and sustainability. Based on the recent achievements in the synthesis of ortho-iodobiaryls following a Catellani strategy, the overall objective of this proposal is the development of a general and sustainable method for the direct synthesis of ortho-iodobiaryls and selectively substituted haloarenes as valuable intermediates for the synthesis of a large number of high value-added compounds. The project aims also to develop protocols for the straightforward synthesis of new biaryl-containing phosphines, as a valuable application of this methodology. CAT4Arene will allow the selective construction of halogenated biaryls and arenes which can be further easily converted into a broad variety of high value-added compounds. In particular, thanks to the easily manipulation of the C-halogen bond, especially C-I and C-Br bonds, these new methodologies will unlock the direct construction of tricky molecular architectures, including biaryl-containing phosphines and bioactive nitrogen derivatives. Likewise, new classes of organic molecules would be also accessed, unlocking the opportunity to enlarge the range of compounds available for the medicinal chemistry and the agrochemical industry. The development of unconventional haloarenes formation protocols will be an outstanding breakthrough for the organic chemistry community.']"

Predominant etiological factors are obesity, type2 diabetes, and increased alcohol in-take, which are all on the rise. It is predicted that healthy life expectancy will decrease in Europe over the next 30 years because of deaths due to liver disease. Liver cirrhosis develops after a very long period of asymptomatic liver fibrosis, staying undetected until patients develop severe complications due to cirrhosis or liver cancer. Currently the only effective treatment available is liver transplantation which is not applicable to all patients. If fibrosis is detected early, to target the course of liver disease, then liver fibrosis is reversible. The LIVERAIM project concentrates a team of renowned clinical centres and Industrial partners, including SMEs, with great expertise in the field of Liver Disease, the aim being to design and validate a screening platform with biomarkers for population screening to use across Europe. The objective is to identify liver disease early and apply personalized therapeutic interventions. A large number of existing biomarkers will be tested for fibrosis prediction accuracy using biobank plasma samples from 40,000 subjects from previous H2020 EU-funded cohorts. LIVERAIM will develop a screening platform with biomarkers using AI for personalized early diagnosis of fibrosis to be validated in a RCT of 100K subjects from 6 representative EU countries. The platform will be linked to tailored, personalized therapeutic interventions to halt fibrosis progression. With LIVERAIM, early diagnosis and personalized intervention can stop liver disease progression, help decrease morbidity and mortality and the associated societal burdens both economic and health inequity.', 'Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by hepatic steatosis and damage. This drives liver inflammation, promoting the progression to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and liver fibrosis. There are currently no approved therapies for NASH and fibrosis, which is in part due to a lack of knowledge of the immunological events underpinning NASH and fibrosis. The pathogenesis of NASH is strongly influenced by crosstalk with other tissues. There is increasing evidence that specifically obese adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) are directly linked to liver pathology. In this respect, the host lab has shown that obese ATMs increase hepatic macrophage number. However, the exact changes in macrophage subsets and phenotypes were not investigated. I recently demonstrated that in NASH liver macrophages display large heterogeneity in phenotype and tissue localization and this plays a key role in NASH-associated liver fibrosis. Based on this combined preliminary data generated by the host lab and me, I hypothesize that ATMs alter hepatic macrophage composition and consequently affect the progression of NASH to liver fibrosis. By combining the mouse models and expertise available in the host lab and advanced technology present at the host institute, with my expertise in detailed immunophenotyping of the liver in NASH and fibrosis, I will address this innovative hypothesis in great detail. To bridge the translational gap from animal studies, I will investigate the potential contribution of ATMs to hepatic inflammation and fibrosis in humans by using unique fresh paired adipose tissue and liver biopsies available through the clinical network of the host lab. MacTalk integrates the scientific and technical expertise of both me and the host lab, creating a unique framework to identify novel mediators of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis. Furthermore, MacTalk will lay a strong foundation for my future career as independent researcher in the field of liver fibrosis.', 'With the obesity epidemic, global prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is currently at 25% and rising. NAFLD results from accumulation of excessive fat in the liver and covers a spectrum of disease states from simple steatosis (fatty liver) to severe non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NAFLD patients are also at increased risk of developing secondary pathologies, including infections and paracetamol-induced liver damage, although the mechanisms behind this remain unclear. As no pharmacological treatment of NAFLD exists to date, patients are typically instructed to lose weight as this can alleviate symptoms. However, with the recent proposal of tissue memory of inflammation, including NAFLD, it is unclear if weight loss alone is sufficient to restore liver homeostasis or if recovered NAFLD patients remain more susceptible to secondary inflammatory events. Recently, the host labs have identified key cell-cell circuits that control the functional specialization of liver resident macrophages in the steady-state and fatty liver. These findings led me to hypothesize that NAFLD could lead to tissue memory by disrupting the interactions between resident liver cells and establish aberrant cell-cell circuits that maintain a pathological state even after weight loss. Furthermore, I postulate that this NAFLD memory could facilitate the relapse into NAFLD but also modulate susceptibility to secondary insults. Indeed, my preliminary data indicates altered susceptibility to paracetamol overdose.  Here, I propose to use single-cell RNA sequencing and epigenetics to investigate how cell-circuits in the liver are perturbed after NAFLD regression and identify the signals underlying these alterations. This project will further our understanding on how liver circuits are distorted in disease and could provide therapeutic avenues to ‘reset’ pathogenic liver circuits in patients currently suffering from NAFLD or those in the process of weight loss and recovery.']"

The 7 REDs targeted are Aniridia-Associated Keratopathy, Neurotrophic Keratopathy, Limbal Stem Cell Deficiency, Ocular Cicatricial Pemphigoid, EEC Syndrome, Ocular Graft versus Host Disease and Corneal Neovascularisation, affecting over 500k patients in Europe.Current management is often prohibitively expensive, has low efficacy and leads to debilitating side effects, pointing to a critical medical problem and area of unmet medical need.

However, clinical application of mRNAs is limited by their poor in vivo stability and low cellular entry. Therefore, efficient and safe delivery systems for ocular mRNA transfer are urgently needed.Our research program aims to develop lipid-based nanoparticle (LNP) systems that are specifically tailored for mRNA delivery into the corneal, conjunctival and retinal cells. The project will address the critical anatomical and physiological barriers of ocular mRNA delivery topically and intravitreally. Chemical structure and composition of LNPs will be carefully modified to optimize mRNA delivery across ocular barriers. Smart pH-sensitive LNPs with eye specific surface moieties will be used to target ocular cells and trigger mRNA release and cytosolic delivery. Moreover, eye drop formulations will be mucoadhesive, increasing precorneal residence time, whereas intravitreal injectables will be capable of permeating in the vitreous and inner limiting membrane into the retinal cells. The representative in vitro and ex vivo test models will be used to select the most promising LNPs for versatile animal experiments.

While macrostructural biomarkers related to ocular shape are well-established, microstructural biomarkers related to tissue remain largely unexplored. The project's foundation rests on the preliminary work of the PI, which demonstrated the feasibility of deriving disease-related microstructure biomarkers from low-resolution clinical eye images. The approach combines data science, advanced image processing, and rigorous experimental validation to better understand the interplay between macro- and microstructural biomarkers in prevalent sight-threatening eye diseases, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), glaucoma, cataracts, and corneal ectasia, using efficient, cost-effective, and accessible tools. VISIONSAFE covers several ground-breaking aspects: clinical eye data is already available but underused (can we use data science for vision preservation?); the acquisition and combination of macro- and microstructural biomarkers from clinical images have not yet been considered (is this combination a key for the early diagnosis of eye diseases? Are we missing out essential information from already available data?). The project's potential gains are significant. It enhances knowledge on eye disease biomarkers accessible through routine eye exams, shifts the paradigm toward macro- and microstructural biomarker synergy, and represents an important step towards a future where eye diseases are identified and managed earlier, offering hope and improved quality of life to countless individuals.""]"
